# Context Summary: Toggleable Grid Feature
**Date:** December 19, 2024
**Phase:** Phase 3 Enhancement (Canvas Grid System)
**Status:** Completed

## What Was Built
Implemented a toggleable grid overlay for the canvas background to provide visual alignment assistance. The grid renders at 20px intervals with light gray lines and can be toggled on/off via a button in the toolbar.

## Key Files Modified/Created
- `_docs/PRD.md` - Added grid feature to MVP scope and acceptance criteria
- `_docs/TASK_LIST.md` - Added grid implementation tasks to Phase 3
- `src/hooks/useCanvas.ts` - Added grid state management and toggle functionality
- `src/components/Canvas.tsx` - Implemented grid rendering with performance optimization
- `src/components/Toolbar.tsx` - Added grid toggle button with visual state

## Technical Decisions Made
- **Grid Spacing:** 20px intervals for optimal visual alignment without clutter
- **Grid Styling:** Light gray (#e9ecef) with 0.5 opacity for subtle visibility
- **Performance Optimization:** Used useMemo to calculate visible grid lines based on viewport
- **Rendering Strategy:** Only render grid lines visible in current viewport to maintain 60 FPS
- **State Management:** Added grid state to existing useCanvas hook for consistency

## Dependencies & Integrations
- Depends on: Canvas viewport state (scale, x, y) for grid positioning
- Integrates with: Existing toolbar button system and canvas rendering pipeline
- Future tasks can depend on: Grid state for snap-to-grid functionality

## State of the Application
- Grid toggle button works correctly in toolbar
- Grid renders properly at all zoom levels (0.1x to 5x)
- Grid maintains 60 FPS performance during pan/zoom operations
- Grid visibility persists during navigation operations
- No linting errors or TypeScript issues

## Known Issues/Technical Debt
- None identified - implementation is clean and performant

## Testing Notes
- Grid button toggles visibility correctly
- Grid renders at proper intervals (20px)
- Performance remains smooth during pan/zoom with grid enabled
- Grid lines are properly styled and visible but not intrusive
- No console errors or warnings

## Next Steps
- Grid feature is complete and ready for use
- Could be extended with snap-to-grid functionality in future phases
- Grid spacing could be made configurable if needed

## Code Snippets for Reference
```typescript
// Grid state in useCanvas hook
const [grid, setGrid] = useState({
  isVisible: false,
  spacing: 20,
  color: '#e9ecef',
  opacity: 0.5
});

// Grid rendering optimization
const gridLines = useMemo(() => {
  if (!grid.isVisible) return [];
  // Calculate visible grid range based on viewport
  // Generate only visible lines for performance
}, [grid.isVisible, grid.spacing, grid.color, grid.opacity, bounds.width, bounds.height, viewport.x, viewport.y, viewport.scale]);
```

## Questions for Next Session
- None - feature is complete and working as specified
