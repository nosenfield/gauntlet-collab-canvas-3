# Context Summary: Canvas Boundary Constraints
**Date:** 2025-10-18
**Phase:** STAGE3 (Transform Modal Interactions)
**Status:** Completed

## What Was Built
Added canvas boundary constraints to rotation and scale operations to prevent objects from being transformed outside the 10,000 x 10,000px canvas drawing area. Previously, only individual drag and collection drag operations were constrained to canvas boundaries.

## Key Files Modified
- `src/features/displayObjects/common/hooks/useRotation.ts` - Added `constrainToCanvas` after rotation
- `src/features/displayObjects/common/hooks/useScale.ts` - Added `constrainToCanvas` after scaling

## Technical Decisions Made

### Boundary Constraints Applied:
**Before this change:**
- ✅ Individual shape drag - constrained via `dragBoundFunc` in `RectangleShape.tsx`
- ✅ Collection drag - constrained via `translateAndConstrain` in `transformService.ts`
- ❌ Rotation - NOT constrained
- ❌ Scale - NOT constrained

**After this change:**
- ✅ Individual shape drag - constrained via `dragBoundFunc`
- ✅ Collection drag - constrained via `translateAndConstrain`
- ✅ Rotation - constrained via `constrainToCanvas`
- ✅ Scale - constrained via `constrainToCanvas`

### Canvas Boundaries:
```typescript
const CANVAS_CONFIG = {
  MIN_X: 0,
  MIN_Y: 0,
  MAX_X: 10000,
  MAX_Y: 10000,
}
```

### Implementation Pattern:
Both rotation and scale hooks now apply `constrainToCanvas()` in three places:
1. **Optimistic update** - Immediately when user moves mouse
2. **Debounced write** - 300ms after last mouse move
3. **Final write** - On mouse up (if debounce hasn't fired)

### Constraint Logic:
The `constrainToCanvas` function:
1. Calculates the bounding box of the entire collection
2. Determines if any part extends beyond canvas edges
3. Adjusts ALL objects by the same offset to bring the collection within bounds
4. Preserves relative positioning of objects within the collection

## Dependencies & Integrations
- **Uses:** `constrainToCanvas` from `transformService.ts`
- **Pattern:** Matches existing collection drag behavior
- **Affects:** All rotation and scale interactions

## State of the Application
- ✅ Individual shapes cannot be dragged outside canvas
- ✅ Collections cannot be dragged outside canvas
- ✅ Rotated objects/collections cannot extend outside canvas
- ✅ Scaled objects/collections cannot extend outside canvas
- ✅ Constraints apply to optimistic updates (real-time feedback)
- ✅ Constraints apply to database writes (persistent state)

## Known Issues/Technical Debt
- None - constraints are comprehensive and consistent across all transform operations

## Testing Notes
**Test boundary constraints:**
1. **Rotation at edge:**
   - Create objects near canvas edge (e.g., x=9500, y=9500)
   - Select and rotate
   - **Expected:** Objects constrain to stay within 0-10000 on both axes

2. **Scale at edge:**
   - Create objects near canvas edge
   - Select and scale up (make larger)
   - **Expected:** Objects constrain to stay within canvas boundaries

3. **Collection rotation:**
   - Create multiple objects spanning across canvas
   - Select all and rotate near edge
   - **Expected:** Entire collection adjusts to stay within bounds

4. **Large scale:**
   - Create small object at center
   - Scale to 100x (very large)
   - **Expected:** Object constrains if it would exceed canvas edges

## Next Steps
- STAGE3-11: Properties Panel for numeric property editing
- Consider adding visual feedback when hitting boundary constraints

## Code Snippets for Reference

### Rotation Hook (useRotation.ts)
```typescript
// In updateRotation callback:
const rotatedObjects = rotateCollection(
  originalObjectsRef.current,
  cumulativeAngleRef.current,
  initialCenterRef.current
);

// Constrain rotated objects to canvas boundaries
const constrainedObjects = constrainToCanvas(rotatedObjects);

// Update local state immediately (optimistic)
constrainedObjects.forEach(obj => {
  updateShapeLocal(obj.id, {
    x: obj.x,
    y: obj.y,
    rotation: obj.rotation,
  });
});
```

### Scale Hook (useScale.ts)
```typescript
// In updateScale callback:
const scaledObjects = scaleCollection(
  originalObjectsRef.current,
  cumulativeScaleRef.current,
  initialCenterRef.current
);

// Constrain scaled objects to canvas boundaries
const constrainedObjects = constrainToCanvas(scaledObjects);

// Update local state immediately (optimistic)
constrainedObjects.forEach(obj => {
  updateShapeLocal(obj.id, {
    x: obj.x,
    y: obj.y,
    scaleX: obj.scaleX,
    scaleY: obj.scaleY,
  });
});
```

### Transform Service (transformService.ts)
```typescript
export function constrainToCanvas(
  objects: ShapeDisplayObject[]
): ShapeDisplayObject[] {
  if (objects.length === 0) {
    return objects;
  }
  
  // Get collection bounds
  const bounds = getCollectionBounds(objects);
  
  // Calculate adjustment needed
  let adjustX = 0;
  let adjustY = 0;
  
  if (bounds.minX < CANVAS_CONFIG.MIN_X) {
    adjustX = CANVAS_CONFIG.MIN_X - bounds.minX;
  } else if (bounds.maxX > CANVAS_CONFIG.MAX_X) {
    adjustX = CANVAS_CONFIG.MAX_X - bounds.maxX;
  }
  
  if (bounds.minY < CANVAS_CONFIG.MIN_Y) {
    adjustY = CANVAS_CONFIG.MIN_Y - bounds.minY;
  } else if (bounds.maxY > CANVAS_CONFIG.MAX_Y) {
    adjustY = CANVAS_CONFIG.MAX_Y - bounds.maxY;
  }
  
  // Apply adjustment to all objects
  return objects.map(obj => ({
    ...obj,
    x: obj.x + adjustX,
    y: obj.y + adjustY,
  }));
}
```

## Questions for Next Session
- Should we add visual feedback when objects hit canvas boundaries (e.g., temporary red border)?
- Should we prevent starting transforms if they would immediately violate boundaries?
- Should we add an "infinite canvas" mode toggle for future versions?
