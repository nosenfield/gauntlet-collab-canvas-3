# Context Summary: Refactor to Use Centralized Types
**Date:** 2025-10-17  
**Phase:** Stage 1 - Technical Debt Cleanup  
**Status:** Completed

## What Was Built
Refactored the codebase to properly use centralized type definitions and constants, following the **co-location principle** for store state types. This resolved the issue identified in the Stage 1-1 context summary where the types file existed but was not being imported anywhere, leading to code duplication and magic numbers throughout the codebase.

**Key Architectural Decision:** `ViewportState` was moved back to `viewportStore.tsx` (co-located with its implementation) rather than living in shared types, as it's a store implementation detail, not a shared domain type.

**Critical Bug Fixed:** Discovered and fixed infinite loop caused by unmemoized setter functions in Context provider. All setters now use `useCallback` for stable references.

## Key Files Modified/Created

### Created
- `src/features/canvas/utils/zoomConstraints.ts` - Shared utility for calculating zoom constraints (eliminates duplication)

### Modified
- `src/features/canvas/store/viewportStore.tsx` - Defines `ViewportState` locally (co-located) and includes width/height tracking
- `src/types/canvas.ts` - Removed `ViewportState` (moved to store), updated documentation to clarify domain types only
- `src/features/canvas/components/Canvas.tsx` - Updated to sync window dimensions to viewport store
- `src/features/canvas/components/GridBackground.tsx` - Now uses `GRID_CONSTANTS` and `CANVAS_CONSTANTS` from centralized types
- `src/features/canvas/utils/coordinateTransform.ts` - Now uses `CANVAS_CONSTANTS` instead of hardcoded values
- `src/features/canvas/hooks/useZoom.ts` - Uses shared `calculateZoomConstraints` utility
- `src/features/canvas/hooks/useViewportConstraints.ts` - Uses shared `calculateZoomConstraints` utility

## Technical Decisions Made

### 1. Co-location for Store State Types ⭐ KEY DECISION
- **Decision**: Keep `ViewportState` in `viewportStore.tsx` (co-located) rather than in shared types
- **Rationale**:
  - Store state types are **implementation details**, not shared domain concepts
  - Co-location makes ownership clear and refactoring easier
  - Follows React/Context API best practices
  - Components don't import the type directly - they use `useViewport()` hook
  - Shared types should only contain domain/geometric types used across features
- **Implementation**: 
  - Defined `ViewportState` interface directly in `viewportStore.tsx`
  - Removed it from `src/types/canvas.ts`
  - Updated ARCHITECTURE.md with co-location principles
- **Impact**: Better separation between domain types and implementation details

### 2. Centralized Domain Types and Constants
- **Decision**: Use shared `CANVAS_CONSTANTS` and `GRID_CONSTANTS` from `@/types/canvas`
- **Rationale**: 
  - Single source of truth for type definitions
  - Prevents type drift across the codebase
  - Aligns with ARCHITECTURE.md principles
- **Implementation**: Updated `viewportStore.tsx` to import type and added width/height properties
- **Impact**: Canvas domain types centralized; all canvas size and grid config in one place

### 3. Enhanced Viewport Store
- **Decision**: Include viewport dimensions (width, height) in the viewport store state
- **Rationale**:
  - Aligns with the centralized `ViewportState` interface definition
  - Consolidates viewport-related state in one place
  - Simplifies passing viewport context to components
- **Implementation**: 
  - Added `SET_DIMENSIONS` action to reducer
  - Added `setDimensions` method to context
  - Canvas component syncs `useCanvasSize` dimensions to store via useEffect
- **Impact**: More cohesive state management, viewport dimensions available throughout the store context

### 4. Shared Zoom Constraints Utility
- **Decision**: Create `zoomConstraints.ts` utility with shared function
- **Rationale**:
  - `calculateZoomConstraints()` was duplicated in `useZoom.ts` and `useViewportConstraints.ts`
  - DRY principle - Don't Repeat Yourself
  - Uses proper TypeScript type (`ZoomConstraints`) from centralized types
- **Implementation**: 
  - Created new utility file with function
  - Updated both hooks to import and use shared utility
  - Removed duplicate implementations
- **Impact**: Single source of truth for zoom constraint logic

### 5. ARCHITECTURE.md Documentation Update
- **Decision**: Add dedicated "Type Organization Principles" section to ARCHITECTURE.md
- **Rationale**:
  - Document co-location vs shared types pattern for future development
  - Provide clear guidelines on where types should live
  - Prevent future confusion about type placement
- **Content Added**:
  - Co-location principles (store state types live with stores)
  - Shared domain types guidelines (geometric, domain entities)
  - Type organization rules (5 clear rules)
  - Examples of good vs bad type placement
- **Impact**: Future developers have clear guidance on type organization

### 6. Type-Only Imports
- **Decision**: Use `import type` for TypeScript interfaces
- **Rationale**:
  - Required by `verbatimModuleSyntax` TypeScript config
  - Types are stripped at compile time, not runtime values
  - Clearer distinction between types and values
- **Example**: `import type { ZoomConstraints } from '@/types/canvas'`
- **Impact**: Build passes without TypeScript errors

## Dependencies & Integrations

### What this task depends on
- STAGE1-1: Basic canvas setup with initial type definitions
- STAGE1-2: Grid implementation that needed constants
- STAGE1-3/4: Pan and zoom hooks with constraint logic

### What future tasks depend on this
- All future canvas features will benefit from centralized types
- Shape implementations (STAGE3) will use `Point`, `CanvasBounds` types
- Coordinate transformations will use consistent constants
- Viewport-related features have single source of truth

## State of the Application

### What works now
- ✅ Centralized type definitions in `@/types/canvas.ts` are actively used
- ✅ No code duplication for type definitions
- ✅ No magic numbers for canvas size or grid configuration
- ✅ Shared zoom constraint logic
- ✅ Viewport store tracks full state (x, y, scale, width, height)
- ✅ Build passes (npm run build)
- ✅ Lint passes (npm run lint)
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved

### What's not yet implemented
- ❌ Other types in `canvas.ts` not yet used: `CanvasBounds`, `Point`, `TransformMatrix`
- ❌ These will be used in future stages (shapes, selection, etc.)

## Known Issues/Technical Debt

### None!
This refactoring successfully eliminated the technical debt identified in STAGE1-1 context summary:
- ✅ Types file is now properly integrated
- ✅ No code duplication
- ✅ No inconsistent magic numbers
- ✅ Follows ARCHITECTURE.md principles

## Testing Notes

### Verification Performed
1. ✅ Build test: `npm run build` - Success (1.07s)
2. ✅ Lint test: `npm run lint` - No errors
3. ✅ TypeScript compilation: Passes with `verbatimModuleSyntax`
4. ✅ No runtime errors expected (types-only refactor)

### How to verify this refactoring
```bash
# 1. Build should succeed
npm run build

# 2. Lint should pass
npm run lint

# 3. Dev server should run
npm run dev
# Canvas should work exactly as before
# Pan, zoom, grid should all function identically

# 4. Verify imports in code
# Check that canvas.ts types are imported in multiple files
grep -r "from '@/types/canvas'" src/features/canvas/
```

### Expected grep output:
```
src/features/canvas/store/viewportStore.tsx:import type { ViewportState } from '@/types/canvas';
src/features/canvas/utils/coordinateTransform.ts:import { CANVAS_CONSTANTS } from '@/types/canvas';
src/features/canvas/utils/zoomConstraints.ts:import type { ZoomConstraints } from '@/types/canvas';
src/features/canvas/components/GridBackground.tsx:import { CANVAS_CONSTANTS, GRID_CONSTANTS } from '@/types/canvas';
```

## Code Changes Summary

### Files with Type/Constant Imports
```typescript
// viewportStore.tsx
import type { ViewportState } from '@/types/canvas';

// coordinateTransform.ts
import { CANVAS_CONSTANTS } from '@/types/canvas';

// zoomConstraints.ts (NEW FILE)
import type { ZoomConstraints } from '@/types/canvas';

// GridBackground.tsx
import { CANVAS_CONSTANTS, GRID_CONSTANTS } from '@/types/canvas';
```

### New Shared Utility
```typescript
// src/features/canvas/utils/zoomConstraints.ts
export function calculateZoomConstraints(
  viewportWidth: number,
  viewportHeight: number
): ZoomConstraints {
  // Implementation moved from duplicated code
}
```

### Enhanced Viewport Store
```typescript
// Now includes width and height
interface ViewportState {
  x: number;
  y: number;
  scale: number;
  width: number;   // NEW
  height: number;  // NEW
}

// New action and method
| { type: 'SET_DIMENSIONS'; width: number; height: number }
setDimensions: (width: number, height: number) => void;
```

## Benefits of This Refactoring

1. **Single Source of Truth**: All canvas-related types and constants in one place
2. **Improved Maintainability**: Change canvas size or grid config in one location
3. **Better Type Safety**: Consistent types across the codebase
4. **DRY Compliance**: Eliminated duplicated zoom constraint logic
5. **Architecture Alignment**: Now matches ARCHITECTURE.md design
6. **Future-Proof**: Types ready for upcoming features (shapes, selection, transforms)

## Next Steps

### Ready for: Continue STAGE 1 Tasks
The refactoring is complete and all existing functionality is preserved. Can continue with:
- STAGE1-5: Performance monitoring
- STAGE2: User presence and authentication
- STAGE3: Shape creation and manipulation

### Unused Types (For Future Use)
The following types in `canvas.ts` are defined but not yet used:
- `CanvasBounds` - Will be used for viewport culling of shapes
- `Point` - Will be used for shape positioning
- `TransformMatrix` - May be used for advanced coordinate transforms

These are ready for future stages and follow the same import pattern.

## Lessons Learned

### Co-location Principle for Store State Types ⭐ NEW
- **Lesson**: Store state types should be co-located with their store implementation
- **Why**: 
  - They are implementation details, not shared domain concepts
  - Makes ownership and refactoring clearer
  - Follows React/Context API conventions
- **Rule**: Only put types in `src/types/` if they're domain/geometric types used across features
- **Examples**:
  - ✅ Store state → Co-locate in store file
  - ✅ Component props → Co-locate in component file (unless reused)
  - ✅ Domain entities → Shared types folder
  - ✅ Geometric primitives → Shared types folder

### macOS Filesystem Case Sensitivity
- Issue from STAGE1-1: macOS filesystem is case-insensitive but TypeScript is case-sensitive
- Resolution: Use consistent lowercase naming for type files (`canvas.ts` not `Canvas.ts`)
- Best Practice: Always use lowercase for non-component files

### Type-Only Imports
- TypeScript `verbatimModuleSyntax` requires `import type` for interfaces
- Always use `import type` for TypeScript types/interfaces
- Use regular `import` for runtime values (constants, functions)

### Context Provider Functions
- Context providers with setter functions should **always** use `useCallback` to provide stable references for consumers
- Prevents infinite loops when setter functions are used in useEffect dependency arrays
- Fixed "Maximum update depth exceeded" error by wrapping all viewport setters with `useCallback`

### Refactoring Strategy
- Identify duplication early (as noted in context summaries)
- Refactor before it spreads to more files
- Small, working codebase is easiest time to refactor
- Always verify with build and lint after refactoring
