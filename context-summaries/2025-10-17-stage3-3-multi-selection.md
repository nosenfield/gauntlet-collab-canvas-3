# Context Summary: STAGE3-3 Multi-Selection Implementation
**Date:** 2025-10-17  
**Phase:** Stage 3 - Display Objects (Universal Editing)  
**Status:** Completed

## What Was Built
Implemented comprehensive multi-selection functionality for display objects, including shift-click to add/remove from selection, marquee (drag-to-select) selection with visual feedback, and a 100-object selection limit for performance.

## Key Files Modified/Created

### Created Files:
- `src/features/displayObjects/common/components/MarqueeBox.tsx` - Visual feedback component for drag-to-select
- `src/features/displayObjects/common/hooks/useMarqueeSelection.ts` - Custom hook for marquee selection logic

### Modified Files:
- `src/features/displayObjects/common/store/selectionStore.tsx` - Added multi-selection support
  - Added `TOGGLE_SELECT` action for shift-click
  - Added `SET_SELECTION` action for marquee
  - Implemented 100-object selection limit
  - Added `toggleSelectShape` and `setSelection` functions

- `src/features/canvas/components/Canvas.tsx` - Integrated multi-selection
  - Added marquee selection handlers (mouseDown, mouseMove, mouseUp)
  - Updated to pass `selectedIds` array instead of single ID
  - Added MarqueeBox rendering layer
  - Integrated shift-click detection

- `src/features/displayObjects/shapes/components/ShapeLayer.tsx` - Updated for multi-selection
  - Changed prop from `selectedShapeId` to `selectedIds` array
  - Updated click handler to accept `isShiftClick` parameter
  - Updated selection checking logic

- `src/features/displayObjects/shapes/components/RectangleShape.tsx` - Added shift-click detection
  - Updated onClick handler to detect shift key
  - Passes `isShiftClick` to parent handler

## Technical Decisions Made

### 1. Selection State Architecture
- **Decision**: Use an array of `selectedIds` instead of a single ID
- **Rationale**: Supports multiple selected objects while maintaining backward compatibility

### 2. Shift-Click Toggle Behavior
- **Decision**: Shift-click toggles selection (adds if not selected, removes if already selected)
- **Rationale**: Standard multi-selection UX pattern from desktop apps (Figma, Photoshop, etc.)

### 3. Marquee Selection Detection
- **Decision**: Start marquee only when clicking empty canvas in select mode
- **Rationale**: Prevents conflicts with shape dragging and creation tools

### 4. Intersection Detection Algorithm
- **Decision**: AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) intersection test
- **Rationale**: Simple and performant; rotation handling can be added later if needed
- **Note**: Created `getShapeBounds()` helper to handle different shape types (rectangle, circle, line)

### 5. 100 Object Selection Limit
- **Decision**: Hard limit of 100 objects in a single selection
- **Rationale**: Performance consideration for transforms and rendering
- **Implementation**: Enforced in reducer with console warning

### 6. Visual Feedback
- **Decision**: Dashed blue rectangle for marquee, same color as selection highlights
- **Rationale**: Consistent with Figma's design patterns

## Dependencies & Integrations

### Depends On:
- Shape rendering system (rectangles)
- Selection store infrastructure
- Tool state management (isSelectMode)
- Canvas viewport transformation

### Enables Future Work:
- Collection-level transforms (rotate, scale)
- Collection bounding boxes
- Group operations
- Copy/paste operations

## State of the Application

### What Works Now:
1. **Single-click selection**: Click a shape to select it (replaces previous selection)
2. **Shift-click multi-selection**: Shift+click to add/remove shapes from selection
3. **Marquee selection**: Drag on empty canvas to select multiple shapes
4. **Selection limit**: Maximum 100 objects can be selected at once
5. **Visual feedback**: Marquee box shows during drag-to-select
6. **Multi-shape highlighting**: All selected shapes show selection highlight

### What's Not Yet Implemented:
- Collection bounding box (AABB)
- Individual object highlights (OBB)
- Transform controls for collections
- Locking mechanism
- Rotation-aware intersection detection

## Known Issues/Technical Debt

### Minor Issues:
1. **Marquee intersection doesn't account for rotation**: Shapes with rotation may not intersect correctly
   - **Fix**: Need to implement OBB intersection test
   - **Priority**: Low (rotation not heavily used yet)

2. **Circle shape bounding box approximation**: Uses diameter as width/height
   - **Fix**: Works for current needs, but could be more precise
   - **Priority**: Low

3. **Line shape bounding box hardcoded**: Uses 10x10px box
   - **Fix**: Should calculate based on line endpoints
   - **Priority**: Medium (lines not yet implemented in UI)

## Testing Notes

### How to Test:
1. **Single-click selection**:
   - Ensure 'select' tool is active (in toolbar)
   - Click any rectangle → should select it
   - Click another → should deselect first and select new one

2. **Shift-click multi-selection**:
   - Select a shape
   - Hold Shift and click another → should add to selection
   - Shift+click an already selected shape → should remove from selection

3. **Marquee selection**:
   - Click and drag on empty canvas → blue dashed rectangle appears
   - Release mouse → all shapes intersecting the box are selected
   - Works with zoom and pan transformations

4. **Selection limit**:
   - Create 100+ shapes (can do in browser console)
   - Marquee select all → only first 100 selected
   - Console warning shows

### Known Edge Cases:
- **Empty canvas click**: Clears selection (as expected)
- **Marquee with zero size**: Clears selection (click without drag)
- **Shift-click in creation mode**: Does nothing (correct - only works in select mode)
- **Dragging a selected shape**: Works correctly, doesn't interfere with marquee

## Code Snippets for Reference

### Selection Store - Toggle Logic
```typescript
case 'TOGGLE_SELECT':
  // Shift-click: toggle selection
  if (state.selectedIds.includes(action.payload)) {
    // Already selected - remove from selection
    return {
      ...state,
      selectedIds: state.selectedIds.filter(id => id !== action.payload),
    };
  } else {
    // Not selected - add to selection (if under limit)
    if (state.selectedIds.length >= MAX_SELECTION_COUNT) {
      console.warn(`[Selection] Cannot select more than ${MAX_SELECTION_COUNT} objects`);
      return state;
    }
    return {
      ...state,
      selectedIds: [...state.selectedIds, action.payload],
    };
  }
```

### Marquee Selection - Intersection Test
```typescript
function shapeIntersectsMarquee(
  shape: ShapeDisplayObject,
  marqueeX: number,
  marqueeY: number,
  marqueeWidth: number,
  marqueeHeight: number
): boolean {
  const { width, height } = getShapeBounds(shape);
  
  const shapeLeft = shape.x - width / 2;
  const shapeRight = shape.x + width / 2;
  const shapeTop = shape.y - height / 2;
  const shapeBottom = shape.y + height / 2;
  
  const marqueeLeft = marqueeX;
  const marqueeRight = marqueeX + marqueeWidth;
  const marqueeTop = marqueeY;
  const marqueeBottom = marqueeY + marqueeHeight;
  
  // AABB intersection test
  return !(
    shapeRight < marqueeLeft ||
    shapeLeft > marqueeRight ||
    shapeBottom < marqueeTop ||
    shapeTop > marqueeBottom
  );
}
```

### Canvas - Event Handler Integration
```typescript
// Marquee selection handlers
const handleStageMouseDown = (e: any) => {
  const clickedOnEmpty = e.target === e.currentTarget;
  if (clickedOnEmpty && isSelectMode()) {
    marqueeMouseDown(e); // Start marquee
  }
};

const handleStageMouseUp = () => {
  if (isMarqueeActive) {
    const selectedShapeIds = marqueeMouseUp();
    if (selectedShapeIds && selectedShapeIds.length > 0) {
      setSelection(selectedShapeIds);
    } else {
      clearSelection(); // Click without drag
    }
  }
};
```

## Next Steps

Based on `TASK_LIST.md`, the next tasks are:

### STAGE3-4: Collection & Individual Bounding Boxes
- Render AABB for entire collection (dashed blue box)
- Render OBB for each selected object (solid blue boxes)
- Handle rotation for OBB calculation

### STAGE3-5: Individual Object Highlights Rendering
- Enhance OBB rendering to account for all transforms
- Optimize rendering performance

### STAGE3-6: Collection-Level Locking
- Implement atomic locking for collections
- Lock heartbeat (5s)
- Auto-release after 60s
- Lock conflict handling

### STAGE3-7: Translation (Drag) Implementation
- Already partially implemented (single shape drag works)
- Need to extend to collection dragging
- Debounced Firestore updates

## Performance Considerations

- **Marquee Calculation**: O(n) complexity where n = number of shapes
  - Current: ~100 shapes = negligible impact
  - With viewport culling: Can scale to 1000+ shapes

- **Selection State Updates**: Immutable updates with array operations
  - Limit of 100 ensures array operations stay fast

- **Rendering**: All selected shapes re-render on selection change
  - Consider memoization if performance issues arise

## Architecture Alignment

This implementation perfectly aligns with the planned architecture from `TASK_LIST.md`:
- ✅ Supports multiple object types (extensible to text, images)
- ✅ Clean separation: store (state) → hooks (logic) → components (UI)
- ✅ Reusable patterns for future display object types
- ✅ Performance-conscious (limits, intersection tests)
- ✅ Standard UX patterns (shift-click, marquee)

## Questions for Next Session

None - implementation is complete and tested. Ready to proceed with STAGE3-4.
