# Context Summary: Batch Write Optimization
**Date:** 2025-10-18
**Phase:** STAGE 3 - STAGE3-9: Rotation Knob Implementation
**Status:** Completed

## What Was Built
Optimized Firestore writes by implementing batch updates for rotation operations. This reduces real-time snapshot events from N (one per object) to 1 (single batch), dramatically improving performance and reducing unnecessary re-renders.

## Key Files Modified/Created
- `src/features/displayObjects/shapes/services/shapeService.ts` - Added `updateShapesBatch()` function
- `src/features/displayObjects/common/hooks/useRotation.ts` - Updated to use batch writes

## Technical Decisions Made
- **Problem:** Rotating N objects triggered N Firestore writes, causing N snapshot events. Each snapshot event fetched ALL shapes, causing excessive updates.
- **Example:** Rotating 3 objects caused 6+ real-time updates (3 writes × 2+ snapshots each).
- **Solution:** Firestore batch writes update multiple documents atomically, triggering only ONE snapshot event.
- **Performance Impact:**
  - Before: N writes → N snapshot events → N × total_shapes fetched
  - After: 1 batch write → 1 snapshot event → 1 × total_shapes fetched

## Code Changes

### New Function in shapeService.ts:
```typescript
/**
 * Update multiple shapes atomically using batch write
 * 
 * Batch writes trigger only ONE real-time update event instead of N events.
 * Use this for transform operations (rotation, scale, drag) that affect multiple shapes.
 */
export const updateShapesBatch = async (
  userId: string,
  updates: Array<{ shapeId: string; updates: UpdateShapeData }>
): Promise<void> => {
  const batch = writeBatch(firestore);
  
  updates.forEach(({ shapeId, updates: shapeUpdates }) => {
    const updateData = {
      ...shapeUpdates,
      lastModifiedBy: userId,
      lastModifiedAt: serverTimestamp(),
    };
    batch.update(getShapeDoc(shapeId), updateData);
  });
  
  await batch.commit();
  console.log('[ShapeService] Batch updated', updates.length, 'shapes');
}
```

### Updated useRotation.ts:
**Before (N writes):**
```typescript
rotatedObjects.forEach(obj => {
  updateShape(obj.id, user.userId, {
    x: obj.x,
    y: obj.y,
    rotation: obj.rotation,
  });
});
```

**After (1 batch write):**
```typescript
const batchUpdates = rotatedObjects.map(obj => ({
  shapeId: obj.id,
  updates: {
    x: obj.x,
    y: obj.y,
    rotation: obj.rotation,
  },
}));

updateShapesBatch(user.userId, batchUpdates);
```

## Dependencies & Integrations
- **Used by:** `useRotation` hook (both debounced and final writes)
- **Should be used by:** Future transform hooks (`useScale`, `useCollectionDrag` optimization)

## State of the Application
- ✅ Rotation triggers only 1 snapshot event (down from N for individual writes, down from 2 for duplicate batch writes)
- ✅ Console logs are clean and minimal
- ✅ Performance significantly improved
- ✅ No visual changes - same behavior, better performance
- ✅ No duplicate writes on rotation end

## Known Issues/Technical Debt
- `useCollectionDrag` could also benefit from batch writes (currently uses individual writes)
- `updateZIndexes` has a TODO comment about using batch writes

## Additional Fix: Duplicate Write Prevention

**Problem discovered:** Even with batch writes, we were still getting 2 snapshot events:
1. Debounced write (300ms timer) fires during rotation
2. Final write in `endRotation` fires after mouse release

Both writes contained the same data, causing unnecessary updates.

**Solution:** Added `hasPendingWriteRef` flag to track uncommitted changes:
- Set to `true` on each rotation update
- Set to `false` when debounced write fires
- In `endRotation`, only write if flag is `true`

This ensures we only write once: either from the debounce timer OR from the final write, never both.

## Testing Notes
**Expected console output on rotation end:**
```
[useRotation] Ended rotation at angle: -329
[useRotation] No uncommitted changes, skipping final write  // ✅ Debounce already fired
[ShapeService] Real-time update: 9 shapes                   // ✅ Single snapshot event
[ShapesStore] Received shape update: 9 shapes               // ✅ Single store update
```

OR if rotation ends quickly (< 300ms):
```
[useRotation] Ended rotation at angle: -50
[ShapeService] Batch updated 3 shapes          // ✅ Final write (debounce never fired)
[ShapeService] Real-time update: 9 shapes      // ✅ Single snapshot event
[ShapesStore] Received shape update: 9 shapes  // ✅ Single store update
```

**Before this fix:**
- 3 objects = 6+ console logs (individual writes)
- OR 2 snapshot events (duplicate batch writes)

**After this fix:**
- 1 batch write
- 1 snapshot event
- No duplicates

## Next Steps
- Continue with STAGE3-10: Scale Knob Implementation (should also use batch writes)
- Consider optimizing `useCollectionDrag` to use batch writes

## Important Context for Next Session
**PERFORMANCE PATTERN:** Always use batch writes for multi-object transforms!

When updating multiple shapes in a single operation:
```typescript
import { updateShapesBatch } from '@/features/displayObjects/shapes/services/shapeService';

const batchUpdates = objects.map(obj => ({
  shapeId: obj.id,
  updates: { x: obj.x, y: obj.y, rotation: obj.rotation },
}));

await updateShapesBatch(userId, batchUpdates);
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Atomic updates (all succeed or all fail)
- ✅ Single snapshot event (vs N events)
- ✅ Better performance (less network overhead)
- ✅ Cleaner console logs

**Firestore Batch Limits:**
- Max 500 operations per batch
- For MVP with <100 objects, this is never an issue
- For production with >500 objects in a selection, split into multiple batches
