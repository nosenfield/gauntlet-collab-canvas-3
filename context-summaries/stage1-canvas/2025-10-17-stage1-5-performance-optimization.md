# Context Summary: Stage 1-5 Performance Optimization & Testing
**Date:** 2025-10-17  
**Phase:** Stage 1 - Canvas with Pan & Zoom (Final Task)  
**Status:** Completed ✅

## What Was Built
Implemented comprehensive performance monitoring and optimizations to ensure Stage 1 meets the **60 FPS target** for all canvas operations. This task completes Stage 1 of the CollabCanvas MVP, establishing a solid foundation for multiplayer features in Stage 2.

### Key Achievements
1. ✅ Created performance monitoring utility with FPS tracking
2. ✅ Integrated real-time FPS monitoring into Canvas component
3. ✅ Added visual FPS overlay (development mode only, toggle with 'F' key)
4. ✅ Verified existing optimizations (viewport culling, non-listening layers)
5. ✅ Confirmed 60 FPS performance for pan and zoom operations
6. ✅ All Stage 1 acceptance criteria verified

## Key Files Modified/Created

### Created
- `src/utils/performanceMonitor.ts` - **NEW** Performance monitoring utilities
  - `FPSMonitor` class for real-time frame rate tracking
  - Global monitoring functions (`startFPSMonitoring`, `stopFPSMonitoring`)
  - Utility functions: `debounce`, `throttle`, `measurePerformance`
  - Automatic warnings when FPS drops below 60
  - Performance metrics interface

### Modified
- `src/features/canvas/components/Canvas.tsx` - Integrated FPS monitoring
  - Added FPS monitoring hook (development mode only)
  - Added visual FPS overlay with toggle ('F' key)
  - Color-coded FPS display (green ≥60, red <60)
  - Real-time frame time display

## Technical Decisions Made

### 1. Comprehensive Performance Monitoring Utility ⭐
- **Decision**: Create reusable `performanceMonitor.ts` utility with multiple tools
- **Rationale**:
  - Provides real-time FPS tracking for development
  - Includes `debounce` and `throttle` utilities needed for future stages
  - Automatic warnings when performance degrades
  - Reusable across all features
- **Implementation**:
  - `FPSMonitor` class with `requestAnimationFrame` loop
  - Calculates FPS over 1-second intervals
  - Logs warnings to console when FPS < 60
  - Exports global singleton for easy integration
- **Impact**: Foundation for performance profiling throughout development

### 2. Development-Only Monitoring
- **Decision**: Enable FPS monitoring only in development mode (`import.meta.env.DEV`)
- **Rationale**:
  - Zero performance impact in production builds
  - Helps developers identify performance regressions early
  - Vite automatically strips development code in production
- **Implementation**: Conditional monitoring based on `import.meta.env.DEV`
- **Impact**: Performance tools available during development without production overhead

### 3. Visual FPS Overlay with Toggle
- **Decision**: Add keyboard-toggled FPS overlay ('F' key)
- **Rationale**:
  - Provides immediate visual feedback during development
  - Non-intrusive (hidden by default, toggle on demand)
  - Color-coded for quick assessment (green = good, red = issues)
  - Shows FPS and frame time for detailed profiling
- **Implementation**: 
  - React state for toggle (`showFPS`)
  - Keyboard event listener for 'F' key
  - Positioned overlay with conditional rendering
  - Color changes based on FPS threshold (60 FPS)
- **Impact**: Instant performance visibility during testing

### 4. Verified Existing Optimizations
- **Decision**: Document and verify optimizations already in place
- **What was already optimized**:
  - ✅ Viewport culling for grid lines (only render visible lines)
  - ✅ Grid Layer with `listening={false}` (no event handlers)
  - ✅ Debounced viewport updates
  - ✅ Efficient coordinate transformations
- **Why this matters**: Stage 1 architecture was already performant
- **Impact**: Confirms architectural decisions from earlier tasks

### 5. Utility Functions for Future Stages
- **Decision**: Include `debounce` and `throttle` in performance utility
- **Rationale**:
  - Required for Stage 2 (cursor updates need throttling)
  - Required for Stage 3 (shape updates need debouncing)
  - Co-locating with performance monitoring makes sense
  - TypeScript-typed with proper generics
- **Implementation**: Generic functions with proper typing
- **Impact**: Ready for high-frequency update scenarios in multiplayer features

# 5. Verify no visual artifacts
```

### Expected Console Output
```javascript
// On app load (development mode):
"CollabCanvas MVP - Stage 1: Canvas with Pan & Zoom initialized"

// If FPS drops below 60:
"⚠️ Performance warning: FPS dropped to [value]"
```

## Code Examples for Reference

### Using Performance Monitor
```typescript
import { startFPSMonitoring, stopFPSMonitoring } from '@/utils/performanceMonitor';

// Start monitoring with callback
startFPSMonitoring((metrics) => {
  console.log(`FPS: ${metrics.fps}, Frame Time: ${metrics.frameTime}ms`);
});

// Stop monitoring
stopFPSMonitoring();
```

### Using Throttle (for cursor updates in Stage 2)
```typescript
import { throttle } from '@/utils/performanceMonitor';

const updateCursor = throttle((x: number, y: number) => {
  // Update cursor position in Realtime Database
}, 50); // Max 20 updates per second
```

### Using Debounce (for shape updates in Stage 3)
```typescript
import { debounce } from '@/utils/performanceMonitor';

const updateShape = debounce((shapeId: string, updates: Partial<Shape>) => {
  // Update shape in Firestore
}, 300); // Wait 300ms after last change
```

### Measuring Function Performance
```typescript
import { measurePerformance } from '@/utils/performanceMonitor';

const result = measurePerformance(
  'Complex Calculation',
  () => {
    // Your complex function
    return calculateComplexValue();
  },
  10 // Warn if takes longer than 10ms
);
```

## Performance Monitoring Architecture

### FPS Monitoring Flow
```
Canvas Component
  ↓
useEffect (development mode only)
  ↓
startFPSMonitoring(callback)
  ↓
FPSMonitor class
  ↓
requestAnimationFrame loop
  ↓
Calculate FPS every 1 second
  ↓
Callback with metrics
  ↓
Update React state (fpsMetrics)
  ↓
Render FPS overlay (if showFPS is true)
```

### Performance Optimization Points
1. **Grid Rendering**: Viewport culling reduces draw calls
2. **Event Handling**: Grid layer has `listening={false}` (no event processing)
3. **Coordinate Transforms**: Efficient math, no unnecessary calculations
4. **Viewport Updates**: Debounced to prevent excessive redraws
5. **FPS Monitoring**: Only active in development, zero production overhead
