# Context Summary: STAGE1-2 - Grid Background
**Date:** 2025-10-17  
**Phase:** Stage 1 - Canvas with Pan/Zoom  
**Status:** Completed

## What Was Built
Implemented a high-performance grid background system with primary and secondary (accent) grid lines. The grid renders with viewport culling for optimal performance and is ready to scale with zoom transformations in future tasks.

## Key Files Modified/Created

### Created
- `src/features/canvas/components/GridBackground.tsx` - Grid rendering component
  - Renders primary grid lines (100px spacing, 25% opacity)
  - Renders secondary grid lines (500px spacing, 50% opacity)
  - Uses viewport culling to only render visible lines
  - Non-interactive layer (listening: false) for performance

- `src/features/canvas/utils/gridUtils.ts` - Grid calculation utilities
  - `calculateVisibleGridLines()` - Determines which lines are in viewport
  - `isAccentLine()` - Checks if a line should be an accent line
  - `getVisibleCanvasBounds()` - Converts viewport to canvas bounds
  - Local CanvasBounds interface (to avoid import issues)

### Modified
- `src/features/canvas/components/Canvas.tsx` - Integrated GridBackground component
  - Added GridBackground layer before shapes layer
  - Exposed viewport state (stageX, stageY, scale) for grid calculations
  - Grid now receives viewport information for culling

## Technical Decisions Made

### 1. Viewport Culling Strategy
- **Decision**: Only render grid lines visible in current viewport
- **Rationale**: 
  - 10,000 x 10,000 canvas = 100 vertical + 100 horizontal lines
  - Most lines are off-screen at any zoom level
  - Rendering all lines would waste CPU/GPU resources
- **Implementation**: Calculate visible bounds, then grid lines within bounds
- **Impact**: Significant performance improvement (10-20 lines vs 200 total)

### 2. Two-Tier Grid System
- **Decision**: Primary lines (100px) and secondary accent lines (500px)
- **Rationale**: Per PRD specification
- **Implementation**:
  - Primary: Every 100px, white 25% opacity
  - Secondary: Every 5th line (500px), white 50% opacity
  - `isAccentLine()` checks if position is multiple of (spacing * 5)
- **Visual Effect**: Secondary lines are more prominent, help with orientation

### 3. Non-Interactive Layer
- **Decision**: Set `listening: false` on grid Layer
- **Rationale**:
  - Grid doesn't need to respond to mouse events
  - Reduces event processing overhead
  - Konva optimization for static layers
- **Implementation**: `<Layer listening={false}>`
- **Impact**: Better performance, especially during interactions

### 4. Background Rect
- **Decision**: Render full 10,000 x 10,000 background Rect
- **Rationale**:
  - Ensures dark gray background covers entire canvas
  - Prevents white "gaps" when panning
  - Single rect is more efficient than filling viewport
- **Implementation**: Rect at (0,0) with width/height 10,000
- **Impact**: Consistent background at all zoom/pan levels

### 5. Workaround for TypeScript Import Issue
- **Issue**: Couldn't import CanvasBounds from types/canvas
- **Decision**: Define CanvasBounds locally in gridUtils.ts
- **Rationale**:
  - Pragmatic solution to unblock development
  - Type is simple (4 properties)
  - Can be refactored later if needed
- **Impact**: Temporary code duplication, but functional
- **TODO**: Investigate and fix type imports system-wide

### 6. Floating Point Comparison
- **Decision**: Use epsilon (0.01) for accent line comparison
- **Rationale**: Floating point arithmetic can introduce tiny errors
- **Implementation**: `Math.abs(position % accentSpacing) < 0.01`
- **Impact**: Reliable accent line detection regardless of floating point precision

## Dependencies & Integrations

### What this task depends on
- STAGE1-1: Canvas component and Stage structure
- types/canvas: CanvasConfig constants (100px spacing, etc.)
- Konva.js: Line and Rect components

### What future tasks depend on this
- **STAGE1-3**: Pan will update stageX/stageY, grid will re-cull automatically
- **STAGE1-4**: Zoom will update scale, grid will scale with viewport
- **STAGE1-5**: Performance testing will measure grid rendering FPS

## State of the Application

### What works now
- ✅ Grid renders with correct spacing (100px primary, 500px secondary)
- ✅ Grid lines have correct opacity (25% primary, 50% secondary)
- ✅ Dark gray background (#2A2A2A) covers entire canvas
- ✅ Viewport culling reduces rendered lines
- ✅ Grid is non-interactive (doesn't block mouse events)
- ✅ Build succeeds without errors
- ✅ Lint passes without warnings

### What's not yet implemented
- ❌ Grid doesn't scale with zoom yet (scale hardcoded to 1)
- ❌ Grid doesn't update when panning (stageX/Y hardcoded to 0)
- ❌ No visual feedback for canvas boundaries yet
- ❌ Performance monitoring (STAGE1-5)

## Known Issues/Technical Debt

### ReactKonva JSX Comments Issue (RESOLVED)
- **Issue**: "Text components are not supported" error in console
- **Root Cause**: JSX comments (e.g., `{/* comment */}`) inside Konva components are treated as text nodes
- **Resolution**: Removed all JSX comments from inside `<Layer>` and other Konva components
- **Fix Applied**: 
  - GridBackground.tsx: Removed comments between Konva components
  - Canvas.tsx: Removed comments inside Stage
- **Impact**: Error resolved, grid renders correctly
- **Lesson**: ReactKonva only supports Konva components, not text nodes or comments

### TypeScript Import Issue
- **Issue**: Cannot import CanvasBounds from types/canvas
- **Workaround**: Duplicated interface in gridUtils.ts
- **Root Cause**: Likely TypeScript path resolution or caching issue
- **TODO**: Investigate and fix in future refactoring
- **Impact**: Minor code duplication, functionally correct

### Grid Scaling Not Dynamic
- **Issue**: Grid rendered at scale=1 regardless of zoom
- **Status**: Expected - zoom not implemented yet
- **Resolution**: STAGE1-4 will make scale dynamic
- **Impact**: Grid won't scale until zoom is implemented

### Canvas Boundary Not Enforced
- **Issue**: No visual indication of 10,000 x 10,000 boundary
- **Status**: Expected for now
- **Resolution**: Pan implementation (STAGE1-3) will enforce bounds
- **Impact**: Users could theoretically pan outside canvas

## Testing Notes

### Verification Performed
1. ✅ Build test: `npm run build` - Success (893ms)
2. ✅ Lint test: `npm run lint` - No errors
3. ✅ Visual test: Grid renders with correct spacing
4. ✅ Opacity test: Primary and secondary lines have different opacity
5. ✅ Background test: Dark gray covers entire canvas

### How to verify this task is complete

```bash
# 1. Build should succeed
npm run build

# 2. Lint should pass
npm run lint

# 3. Dev server should run
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:5173

# Visual Checks:
# - Dark gray background (#2A2A2A) fills screen
# - White grid lines visible
# - Primary lines: thin, subtle (25% opacity)
# - Secondary lines: more prominent every 500px (50% opacity)
# - Grid lines spaced evenly (100px primary)
# - No errors in console
```

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Open browser to http://localhost:5173
3. **Verify grid pattern**:
   - Should see white grid lines on dark gray background
   - Primary lines: subtle, every 100px
   - Secondary lines: brighter, every 500px (every 5th line)
4. **Verify spacing**: Use browser ruler or DevTools to measure
   - Primary spacing should be ~100px (adjusted for scale)
   - Secondary spacing should be ~500px
5. **Verify opacity**: Secondary lines should be noticeably brighter
6. **Check console**: No errors or warnings

### Expected Visual Output
```
Dark gray canvas with white grid:
- Thin subtle lines (25% opacity) every 100px
- Thicker prominent lines (50% opacity) every 500px
- Evenly spaced grid pattern
- Grid covers entire visible viewport
```

## Next Steps

### Ready for: STAGE1-3 - Pan Implementation
**Prerequisites**: STAGE1-1, STAGE1-2 complete ✅  
**What to create**:
- `src/features/canvas/hooks/usePan.ts` - Pan gesture handling
- `src/features/canvas/store/viewportStore.ts` - Viewport state management
- `src/features/canvas/utils/coordinateTransform.ts` - Coordinate conversions
- Integrate pan handlers into Canvas component

**Key considerations**:
- Track mouse drag events
- Calculate delta movement
- Update Stage x/y position
- Constrain to canvas boundaries (0,0 to 10000,10000)
- Smooth 60 FPS performance
- Grid will automatically re-cull when viewport changes

## Code Snippets for Reference

### Grid Rendering Pattern
```typescript
<Layer listening={false}>
  {/* Background */}
  <Rect x={0} y={0} width={10000} height={10000} fill="#2A2A2A" />
  
  {/* Vertical lines */}
  {gridLines.vertical.map((x) => (
    <Line
      key={`v-${x}`}
      points={[x, 0, x, 10000]}
      stroke="#FFFFFF"
      strokeWidth={1}
      opacity={isAccent ? 0.5 : 0.25}
    />
  ))}
</Layer>
```

### Viewport Culling Logic
```typescript
// Calculate visible bounds
const visibleBounds = getVisibleCanvasBounds(
  stageX, stageY, width, height, scale
);

// Calculate which grid lines are visible
const gridLines = calculateVisibleGridLines(
  visibleBounds,
  PRIMARY_SPACING
);

// Returns: { vertical: [100, 200, 300...], horizontal: [100, 200, 300...] }
```

### Accent Line Detection
```typescript
function isAccentLine(position: number, spacing: number, accentEvery: number): boolean {
  const accentSpacing = spacing * accentEvery; // 100 * 5 = 500
  return Math.abs(position % accentSpacing) < 0.01; // Epsilon for floating point
}
```

### Grid Integration in Canvas
```typescript
<Stage x={stageX} y={stageY} scale={{ x: scale, y: scale }}>
  <GridBackground
    width={width}
    height={height}
    stageX={stageX}
    stageY={stageY}
    scale={scale}
  />
  <Layer>{/* Shapes */}</Layer>
</Stage>
```

## Questions for Next Session

### Regarding Pan Implementation
- Should pan be limited to mouse drag, or also support touch gestures?
- Should we show visual feedback when hitting canvas boundaries?
- How smooth should the pan feel (any easing/momentum)?

### Regarding Performance
- Should we measure current FPS before adding pan?
- Should we implement performance monitoring in STAGE1-3 or wait for STAGE1-5?

### Regarding Grid Optimization
- Should grid lines be memoized/cached?
- Should we use Konva layer caching for the grid?
- At what zoom level should grid density change?
