# Context Summary: STAGE1-1 - Basic Canvas Setup
**Date:** 2025-10-17  
**Phase:** Stage 1 - Canvas with Pan/Zoom  
**Status:** Completed

## What Was Built
Created a basic Konva.js canvas component that fills the entire browser window and responds to window resize events. Established the foundation for a 10,000 x 10,000 pixel coordinate space that will support pan/zoom navigation in subsequent tasks.

## Key Files Modified/Created

### Created
- `src/features/canvas/hooks/useCanvasSize.ts` - Custom hook to track window dimensions
- `src/features/canvas/components/Canvas.tsx` - Main canvas component using Konva Stage
- `src/types/canvas.ts` - TypeScript type definitions for canvas (ViewportState, CanvasConfig, etc.)

### Modified
- `src/App.tsx` - Updated to render Canvas component instead of placeholder
- `src/index.css` - Updated body styles for full-screen canvas (removed flexbox centering)

## Technical Decisions Made

### 1. Canvas Rendering Strategy
- **Decision**: Use Konva.js (react-konva) for canvas rendering
- **Rationale**: 
  - High performance 2D canvas library
  - Built-in support for layers, shapes, transforms
  - React integration with react-konva
  - Better than raw HTML5 Canvas API for complex interactions
- **Implementation**: Stage component wraps Layer components
- **Impact**: Provides foundation for shapes, grid, cursors

### 2. Responsive Canvas Sizing
- **Decision**: Create custom `useCanvasSize` hook
- **Rationale**: 
  - Need to respond to window resize events
  - Centralize resize logic in reusable hook
  - Update dimensions via React state for re-renders
- **Implementation**: 
  - Track window.innerWidth and window.innerHeight
  - Add/remove resize event listener in useEffect
  - Return size object with width and height
- **Impact**: Canvas always fills viewport, no manual resize handling

### 3. Full-Screen Layout
- **Decision**: Use fixed positioning with 100vw/100vh
- **Rationale**:
  - Canvas should fill entire browser window
  - No scrollbars or overflow
  - Fixed position ensures it stays in place
- **CSS**: 
  ```css
  position: fixed;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100vw;
  height: 100vh;
  overflow: hidden;
  ```
- **Impact**: Clean full-screen canvas experience

### 4. Initial Viewport State
- **Decision**: Start with identity transform (x:0, y:0, scale:1)
- **Rationale**:
  - Simple starting point
  - Pan/zoom will be added in STAGE1-3 and STAGE1-4
  - Top-left of viewport aligns with top-left of canvas initially
- **Impact**: No transformation applied yet, ready for pan/zoom

### 5. Background Color
- **Decision**: Use dark gray (#2A2A2A)
- **Rationale**: 
  - Matches PRD specification for grid background
  - Professional design tool aesthetic
  - Good contrast for future shapes and grid
- **Impact**: Sets visual style for application

### 6. File Naming Case Issue
- **Issue Encountered**: macOS filesystem is case-insensitive, but TypeScript is case-sensitive
- **Problem**: Created `canvas.ts` but system had `Canvas.ts`, causing import conflicts
- **Resolution**: Deleted conflicting file, recreated as `canvas.ts` (lowercase)
- **Lesson**: Be consistent with lowercase filenames for types/utilities

## Dependencies & Integrations

### What this task depends on
- SETUP-1: Folder structure (`src/features/canvas/`)
- SETUP-2: Type definitions structure (`src/types/`)
- Installed packages: `react-konva`, `konva`

### What future tasks depend on this
- **STAGE1-2**: Grid will be added as a Layer in the Stage
- **STAGE1-3**: Pan functionality will modify Stage x/y position
- **STAGE1-4**: Zoom functionality will modify Stage scale
- **STAGE2-4**: Remote cursors will be rendered in a Layer
- **STAGE3**: Shapes will be rendered in the main Layer

## State of the Application

### What works now
- ✅ Canvas renders and fills entire browser window
- ✅ Window resize updates canvas dimensions automatically
- ✅ Dark gray background (#2A2A2A) displays
- ✅ Konva Stage and Layer structure established
- ✅ Type-safe with TypeScript
- ✅ Build succeeds without errors
- ✅ Lint passes without warnings

### What's not yet implemented
- ❌ Grid background (STAGE1-2)
- ❌ Pan navigation (STAGE1-3)
- ❌ Zoom navigation (STAGE1-4)
- ❌ 10,000x10,000 coordinate space boundaries (will be enforced in pan/zoom)
- ❌ Performance monitoring (STAGE1-5)

## Known Issues/Technical Debt

### TypeScript Import Issue (Resolved)
- **Issue**: Initially had problems importing from `@/types/canvas`
- **Cause**: macOS case-insensitive filesystem with TypeScript case-sensitive imports
- **Resolution**: Removed unused import for now; types are defined but not imported in component
- **TODO**: Ensure consistent lowercase naming for all type files

### Large Bundle Size Warning
- **Issue**: Build warning about 509KB chunk after minification
- **Cause**: Konva.js and react-konva are large libraries
- **Impact**: Acceptable for MVP, but could be optimized later
- **Resolution**: Deferred - will address if performance issues arise
- **Note**: Consider code-splitting in production

## Testing Notes

### Verification Performed
1. ✅ Build test: `npm run build` - Success (918ms)
2. ✅ Lint test: `npm run lint` - No errors
3. ✅ TypeScript compilation: Passes
4. ✅ Canvas renders (verified in browser)
5. ✅ Window resize updates canvas size

### How to verify this task is complete

```bash
# 1. Build should succeed
npm run build

# 2. Lint should pass
npm run lint

# 3. Dev server should run
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:5173
# Should see: Dark gray full-screen canvas
# No errors in browser console
# "CollabCanvas MVP - Stage 1: Canvas initialized" logged

# 4. Test window resize
# Resize browser window - canvas should adapt
# No scrollbars should appear
# Canvas fills entire window
```

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Open browser to http://localhost:5173
3. Verify dark gray (#2A2A2A) background fills screen
4. Open browser DevTools Console
5. Verify message: "CollabCanvas MVP - Stage 1: Canvas initialized"
6. Resize browser window - canvas should adapt without scrollbars
7. No errors in console

## Next Steps

### Ready for: STAGE1-2 - Grid Background
**Prerequisites**: STAGE1-1 complete ✅  
**What to create**:
- `src/features/canvas/components/GridBackground.tsx` - Grid rendering component
- `src/features/canvas/utils/gridUtils.ts` - Grid line calculation utilities
- Integrate GridBackground into Canvas component as a Layer

**Key considerations**:
- Primary grid lines: 100px spacing, white 25% opacity
- Secondary grid lines: 500px spacing (every 5th), white 50% opacity
- Grid scales with zoom (will be dynamic in STAGE1-4)
- Only render visible grid lines (viewport culling)
- Background color: #2A2A2A (already set)

## Code Snippets for Reference

### Canvas Component Structure
```typescript
<Stage width={width} height={height} x={0} y={0} scale={{ x: 1, y: 1 }}>
  <Layer>
    {/* Shapes will go here */}
  </Layer>
</Stage>
```

### useCanvasSize Hook Pattern
```typescript
const [size, setSize] = useState({
  width: window.innerWidth,
  height: window.innerHeight,
});

useEffect(() => {
  const handleResize = () => {
    setSize({
      width: window.innerWidth,
      height: window.innerHeight,
    });
  };
  window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize);
  return () => window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResize);
}, []);
```

### Full-Screen Canvas Layout
```typescript
<div style={{
  width: '100vw',
  height: '100vh',
  overflow: 'hidden',
  position: 'fixed',
  top: 0,
  left: 0,
  backgroundColor: '#2A2A2A',
}}>
  <Stage {...props} />
</div>
```

## Questions for Next Session

### Regarding Grid Implementation
- Should grid lines be cached/memoized for performance?
- Should we pre-calculate all grid lines or calculate on-demand?
- How to handle grid scaling (will be addressed in STAGE1-4)?

### Regarding Type System
- Should we create a barrel export (index.ts) for types?
- Best pattern for importing canvas types in components?

**Task Completion**: STAGE1-1 ✅  
**Build Status**: Passing ✅  
**Lint Status**: Passing ✅  
**Canvas**: Renders full-screen with dark background ✅  
**Responsive**: Updates on window resize ✅  
**Ready for**: STAGE1-2 (Grid Background)

**Performance Note**: Canvas currently renders empty layer - performance will be measured more accurately in STAGE1-5 after grid, pan, and zoom are implemented.
