# Context Summary: Scale Knob Implementation
**Date:** 2025-10-18
**Phase:** STAGE 3 - STAGE3-10: Scale Knob Implementation
**Status:** Completed

## What Was Built
Implemented scale knob functionality in the transform modal, allowing users to scale selected objects by dragging. Follows the same pattern as rotation with optimistic updates, batch writes, and real-time visual feedback.

## Key Files Created/Modified
- `src/features/displayObjects/common/hooks/useScale.ts` - Created scale interaction hook
- `src/features/displayObjects/common/utils/transformMath.ts` - Enhanced `scaleCollection` function
- `src/features/displayObjects/common/components/TransformModal.tsx` - Integrated scale knob
- `src/features/displayObjects/common/components/TransformModal.css` - Added scale knob styles

## Technical Decisions Made
- **Sensitivity:** 1px drag = 0.002 scale delta (adjusted from 0.01 for less sensitivity)
- **Scale Constraints:** 0.1 to 10.0 (10% to 1000%) per object
- **Scaling Logic:** Scale both object positions AND scale properties (scaleX/scaleY)
- **Pivot Point:** Objects scale from collection center
- **Position Handling:** Convert top-left to center, scale, then convert back (same as rotation)
- **Batch Writes:** Use `updateShapesBatch` to reduce N writes to 1
- **Duplicate Prevention:** Use `hasPendingWriteRef` flag to avoid double writes

## Architecture Flow

### Scale Interaction:
```
1. User drags scale knob
2. useScale calculates scale delta (1px = 0.01)
3. Apply to cumulative scale (clamped 0.1 to 10.0)
4. scaleCollection() transforms objects:
   - Convert object top-left to center
   - Scale center position relative to collection center
   - Apply scale to scaleX/scaleY properties
   - Apply per-object constraints
   - Convert back to top-left
5. Optimistic local update (immediate UI)
6. Debounced batch write (300ms)
7. On release: final write if uncommitted changes exist
```

## Scale Transformation Math

**For each object:**
1. Calculate object center from top-left:
   ```typescript
   centerX = x + (width * scaleX) / 2
   centerY = y + (height * scaleY) / 2
   ```

2. Scale center position relative to collection center:
   ```typescript
   deltaX = objectCenter.x - collectionCenter.x
   deltaY = objectCenter.y - collectionCenter.y
   newCenterX = collectionCenter.x + (deltaX * scaleFactor)
   newCenterY = collectionCenter.y + (deltaY * scaleFactor)
   ```

3. Apply scale to object properties (with constraints):
   ```typescript
   newScaleX = clamp(scaleX * scaleFactor, 0.1, 10.0)
   newScaleY = clamp(scaleY * scaleFactor, 0.1, 10.0)
   ```

4. Convert back to top-left coordinates:
   ```typescript
   newX = newCenterX - (width * newScaleX) / 2
   newY = newCenterY - (height * newScaleY) / 2
   ```

## Code Patterns

### useScale Hook
- Similar structure to `useRotation`
- Tracks cumulative scale (starts at 1.0)
- Mouse movement: deltaX + deltaY → scale delta
- Optimistic updates via `updateShapeLocal`
- Debounced batch writes (300ms)
- Prevents duplicate writes with `hasPendingWriteRef`

### Visual Feedback
- **Active state:** Knob highlights blue and scales up slightly when active (via CSS)
- **Cursor feedback:** Changes from `grab` to `grabbing` during interaction
- **No icon scaling:** The knob itself remains fixed size (static UI element)
- **Feedback through objects:** Visual feedback comes from seeing the objects scale in real-time

## Dependencies & Integrations
- **Depends on:** `scaleCollection` in transformMath.ts, `updateShapesBatch` in shapeService.ts
- **Used by:** TransformModal component
- **Pattern:** Matches rotation implementation for consistency

## State of the Application
- ✅ Scale knob responds to drag
- ✅ 1px = 0.002 scale delta (5x less sensitive than rotation)
- ✅ Objects scale from collection center
- ✅ Scale properties (scaleX/scaleY) update correctly
- ✅ Position updates correctly (objects move outward/inward)
- ✅ Constraints applied (0.1 to 10.0)
- ✅ Optimistic updates work smoothly
- ✅ Batch writes reduce database operations
- ✅ No duplicate writes on scale end
- ✅ Visual feedback (active state, cursor change, objects scale in real-time)

## Known Issues/Technical Debt
- **Fixed:** Y-axis inversion - Initial implementation had Right/Down = grow, but UX requirement is Right/Up = grow. Changed from `deltaX + deltaY` to `deltaX - deltaY` to account for screen coordinate system (Y increases downward).
- **Fixed:** Scale sensitivity reduced from 0.01 to 0.002 (5x less sensitive) per user feedback

## Testing Notes
**Test scale behavior:**
1. Select single or multiple objects
2. Drag scale knob right/up (grow) or left/down (shrink)
3. **Expected:** 
   - Objects scale smoothly in real-time
   - Objects move outward when growing, inward when shrinking
   - Knob itself remains fixed size (static UI element)
   - Knob highlights blue when active
   - Cursor changes from grab to grabbing
   - Console shows single batch update, single snapshot
4. Test constraints: Try to scale very small (stops at 0.1x) or very large (stops at 10.0x)
5. Test with quick drags (< 300ms): Should trigger final write, not debounced write

## Next Steps
- Mark STAGE3-10 as complete
- Continue with STAGE3-11: Properties Panel

## Important Context for Next Session
**Transform Patterns Established:**

All transforms (rotation, drag, scale) now follow the same pattern:
1. **Hook structure:** useState for UI state, useRef for tracking, useCallback for handlers
2. **Mouse tracking:** Store initial position, calculate deltas
3. **Optimistic updates:** `updateShapeLocal` for immediate UI feedback
4. **Debounced writes:** 300ms delay, batch updates
5. **Duplicate prevention:** `hasPendingWriteRef` flag
6. **Global mouse handlers:** Capture mouse release outside knob
7. **Transform math:** Convert to center → transform → convert back to top-left

**Key Insight for Scaling:**
Unlike rotation (which only affects rotation property), scaling affects:
- Object positions (relative to pivot)
- scaleX/scaleY properties
- Requires recalculating half-widths/heights after scaling
- Must apply constraints per-object to prevent extreme scales

**Scaling Direction:**
- Right/Down = grow (positive delta)
- Left/Up = shrink (negative delta)
- Scale factor multiplies with original object properties
- Cumulative scale starts at 1.0 (original size)
