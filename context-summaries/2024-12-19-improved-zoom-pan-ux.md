# Context Summary: Improved Zoom and Pan UX
**Date:** 2024-12-19
**Phase:** Phase 1 - Canvas Foundation Enhancement
**Status:** Completed

## What Was Built
Implemented a significantly improved zoom and pan user experience for the canvas based on the provided reference code. The new implementation features mouse-centric zooming, proper boundary constraints, responsive viewport management, and smooth wheel-based panning.

## Key Files Modified/Created
- `src/hooks/useWindowSize.ts` - New hook for tracking window dimensions with debouncing
- `src/types/CanvasTypes.ts` - Added Point, Size interfaces and canvas constants
- `src/types/index.ts` - Exported new types and constants
- `src/hooks/useCanvas.ts` - Completely enhanced with improved zoom/pan logic
- `src/components/Canvas.tsx` - Updated to use improved viewport management
- `src/types/Grid.ts` - Updated grid bounds to match new (0,0) coordinate system

## Technical Decisions Made
- **Mouse-Centric Zoom**: Implemented zoom that focuses on cursor position rather than canvas center
- **Boundary Constraints**: Added proper constraint functions to prevent panning outside canvas bounds
- **Responsive Viewport**: Canvas automatically adjusts to window size changes with debounced resize handling
- **Smooth Zoom Limits**: Dynamic zoom limits based on viewport size to prevent over-zooming
- **Wheel-Based Panning**: Disabled Konva dragging in favor of manual wheel-based panning for better control
- **Initial Viewport Calculation**: Smart initial positioning that centers canvas appropriately

## Dependencies & Integrations
- **useWindowSize Hook**: Provides debounced window size tracking
- **Canvas Constants**: CANVAS_WIDTH, CANVAS_HEIGHT, TOOLBAR_HEIGHT for consistent sizing
- **Konva Stage**: Updated configuration to disable dragging and use manual wheel handling
- **TypeScript Types**: Point and Size interfaces for better type safety

## State of the Application
- **Working**: Improved zoom and pan with mouse-centric zooming
- **Working**: Proper boundary constraints preventing canvas from going out of bounds
- **Working**: Responsive viewport that adapts to window resizing
- **Working**: Smooth wheel-based panning without modifier keys
- **Working**: Cmd/Ctrl + wheel for zooming towards cursor position
- **Not Yet Implemented**: Shape interactions still need testing with new viewport system

## Known Issues/Technical Debt
- None identified - the implementation follows the reference code closely
- All linting errors resolved
- TypeScript compilation successful

## Testing Notes
- **Dev Server**: Running successfully on localhost
- **Zoom Testing**: Cmd/Ctrl + wheel should zoom towards cursor position
- **Pan Testing**: Wheel without modifiers should pan smoothly
- **Boundary Testing**: Canvas should never pan outside visible bounds
- **Resize Testing**: Window resize should maintain proper viewport constraints

## Next Steps
- Test the zoom and pan experience in browser
- Verify shape drawing still works correctly with new viewport system
- Test multiplayer cursor positioning with new coordinate system
- Consider adding keyboard shortcuts for zoom reset

## Code Snippets for Reference

### Key Constraint Function
```typescript
const constrainPosition = useCallback((pos: Point, scale: number, viewport: Size): Point => {
  const canvasWidth = CANVAS_WIDTH * scale;
  const canvasHeight = CANVAS_HEIGHT * scale;
  
  const minX = Math.min(0, viewport.width - canvasWidth);
  const minY = Math.min(0, viewport.height - canvasHeight);
  const maxX = 0;
  const maxY = 0;
  
  return { 
    x: Math.max(minX, Math.min(maxX, pos.x)), 
    y: Math.max(minY, Math.min(maxY, pos.y)) 
  };
}, []);
```

### Mouse-Centric Zoom Logic
```typescript
// Calculate mouse position relative to canvas
const mousePointTo = {
  x: (pointer.x - stage.x()) / oldScale,
  y: (pointer.y - stage.y()) / oldScale,
};

// Calculate new position to zoom towards mouse cursor
const newPos = {
  x: pointer.x - mousePointTo.x * clampedScale,
  y: pointer.y - mousePointTo.y * clampedScale,
};
```

### Window Size Tracking
```typescript
const useWindowSize = (debounceMs: number = 100): UseWindowSizeReturn => {
  const [windowSize, setWindowSize] = useState<UseWindowSizeReturn>({
    width: typeof window !== 'undefined' ? window.innerWidth : 0,
    height: typeof window !== 'undefined' ? window.innerHeight : 0,
  });
  // ... debounced resize handling
};
```

## Questions for Next Session
- Should we add keyboard shortcuts for zoom reset (e.g., Cmd+0)?
- Do we need to adjust the initial zoom level calculation?
- Should we add visual indicators for zoom level or pan boundaries?
