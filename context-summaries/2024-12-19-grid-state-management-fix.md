# Context Summary: Grid State Management Fix
**Date:** December 19, 2024
**Phase:** Phase 3 Enhancement (Canvas Grid System)
**Status:** Completed

## What Was Built
Fixed the grid toggle functionality by resolving a critical state management issue. The problem was that Canvas and Toolbar components were using separate instances of the useCanvas hook, preventing state synchronization.

## Key Files Modified/Created
- `src/App.tsx` - Lifted useCanvas hook to App level and passed as props
- `src/components/Canvas.tsx` - Updated to receive canvasHook as prop instead of calling useCanvas directly
- `src/components/Toolbar.tsx` - Updated to receive canvasHook as prop instead of calling useCanvas directly
- `src/hooks/useCanvas.ts` - Cleaned up debugging code

## Technical Decisions Made
- **State Lifting**: Moved useCanvas hook from individual components to App level
- **Prop Drilling**: Passed canvasHook as prop to both Canvas and Toolbar components
- **Type Safety**: Created proper TypeScript interfaces for CanvasHook type
- **State Sharing**: Ensured both components share the same grid state instance

## Dependencies & Integrations
- Depends on: App component managing shared canvas state
- Integrates with: Both Canvas and Toolbar components now share state
- Future tasks can depend on: Shared canvas state for other features

## State of the Application
- Grid toggle button works correctly in toolbar
- Grid renders properly when toggled on
- Grid state is synchronized between components
- No linting errors or TypeScript issues
- Clean code without debugging artifacts

## Known Issues/Technical Debt
- None identified - state management is now properly implemented

## Testing Notes
- Grid button toggles visibility correctly
- Grid renders at 20px intervals with proper styling
- State changes propagate correctly between components
- No console errors or warnings

## Next Steps
- Grid feature is complete and working correctly
- Could be extended with snap-to-grid functionality in future phases
- Grid spacing could be made configurable if needed

## Code Snippets for Reference
```typescript
// App.tsx - Shared state management
const canvasHook = useCanvas();
return (
  <div className="App">
    <Toolbar canvasHook={canvasHook} />
    <Canvas canvasHook={canvasHook} />
  </div>
);

// Components receive shared state
export const Canvas: React.FC<CanvasProps> = ({ className, canvasHook }) => {
  const { grid, ... } = canvasHook;
  // Grid state is now shared and synchronized
};
```

## Questions for Next Session
- None - feature is complete and working as specified
