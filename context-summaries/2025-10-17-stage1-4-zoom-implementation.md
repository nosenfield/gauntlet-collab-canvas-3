# Context Summary: STAGE1-4 - Zoom Implementation
**Date:** 2025-10-17  
**Phase:** Stage 1 - Canvas with Pan/Zoom  
**Status:** Completed

## What Was Built
Implemented smooth cursor-centered zoom with Cmd/Ctrl + scroll. Users can now zoom in and out while keeping the point under their cursor fixed. The zoom is constrained to show between 100px (max zoom in) and 10,000px (max zoom out) across the viewport dimension. The grid automatically scales with zoom level.

## Key Files Modified/Created

### Created
- `src/features/canvas/hooks/useZoom.ts` - Zoom gesture handling
  - Handles Cmd/Ctrl + wheel events
  - Calculates dynamic zoom constraints based on viewport size
  - Implements cursor-centered zoom algorithm
  - Applies zoom delta from wheel event
  - Constrains viewport to canvas boundaries after zoom
  - Calls onZoom callback with new position and scale

- `src/features/canvas/hooks/useViewportConstraints.ts` - Window resize handling
  - Monitors viewport width/height changes
  - Recalculates zoom constraints on window resize
  - Adjusts scale if current zoom is out of new bounds
  - Reapplies position constraints with new window size
  - Prevents canvas from being revealed beyond viewport when window grows
  - Calls onUpdate with corrected viewport state

### Modified
- `src/features/canvas/components/Canvas.tsx` - Integrated zoom functionality
  - Uses useZoom hook for zoom handling
  - Uses useViewportConstraints hook for window resize handling
  - Combines pan and zoom handlers in unified wheel handler
  - Delegates wheel events based on modifier keys (Cmd/Ctrl = zoom, none = pan)
  - Uses setViewport to update position and scale simultaneously
  - Maintains viewport constraints automatically on resize

- `src/App.tsx` - Updated console message
  - Now shows "Canvas with Pan & Zoom initialized"

## Technical Decisions Made

### 1. Cursor-Centered Zoom Algorithm
- **Decision**: Calculate cursor position in canvas space, then recalculate stage position to keep that point fixed
- **Rationale**:
  - Standard design tool behavior (Figma, Sketch, etc.)
  - Most intuitive user experience
  - Cursor point acts as zoom anchor
- **Implementation**:
  ```typescript
  // 1. Get cursor position in canvas coordinates (before zoom)
  const pointerCanvasX = (pointer.x - currentX) / currentScale;
  const pointerCanvasY = (pointer.y - currentY) / currentScale;
  
  // 2. Calculate new stage position to keep cursor point fixed
  const newX = pointer.x - pointerCanvasX * newScale;
  const newY = pointer.y - pointerCanvasY * newScale;
  ```
- **Impact**: Smooth, predictable zoom behavior

### 2. Dynamic Zoom Constraints
- **Decision**: Calculate min/max scale based on viewport size (not hardcoded)
- **Rationale**:
  - PRD specifies constraints relative to viewport dimensions
  - Max zoom in: 100px across **smaller** dimension
  - Max zoom out: 10,000px across **larger** dimension
  - Constraints adapt to window resize
- **Implementation**:
  ```typescript
  // Max zoom out: Show full canvas across LARGER dimension
  const minScale = Math.max(
    viewportWidth / CANVAS_SIZE,
    viewportHeight / CANVAS_SIZE
  );
  
  // Max zoom in: Show 100px across SMALLER dimension
  const maxScale = Math.min(
    viewportWidth / MIN_VISIBLE_SIZE,
    viewportHeight / MIN_VISIBLE_SIZE
  );
  ```
- **Impact**: Responsive zoom limits that adapt to window size
- **Fix Applied**: Changed minScale from Math.min to Math.max to constrain by larger dimension

### 3. Zoom Speed Calibration
- **Decision**: Use 0.001 as zoom sensitivity factor
- **Rationale**:
  - Provides smooth, controlled zoom
  - Not too fast (jarring) or too slow (tedious)
  - Standard for design tools
- **Implementation**: `const ZOOM_SPEED = 0.001;`
- **Impact**: Comfortable zoom experience

### 4. Combined Wheel Handler
- **Decision**: Single wheel handler that delegates to pan or zoom based on modifier keys
- **Rationale**:
  - Cleaner integration in Canvas component
  - Single event listener (better performance)
  - Clear separation of concerns
- **Implementation**:
  ```typescript
  const handleWheel = (e) => {
    if (e.evt.ctrlKey || e.evt.metaKey) {
      zoomHandlers.handleWheel(e);
    } else {
      panHandlers.handleWheel(e);
    }
  };
  ```
- **Impact**: Efficient event handling

### 5. Viewport State Update Strategy
- **Decision**: Use setViewport (not setPosition + setScale separately)
- **Rationale**:
  - Atomic update of position and scale
  - Prevents intermediate render states
  - Grid updates once with correct position and scale
- **Implementation**: `onZoom: setViewport` (updates x, y, and scale together)
- **Impact**: Smooth rendering without flicker

### 6. Boundary Constraints After Zoom
- **Decision**: Apply constrainViewport after calculating new zoom position
- **Rationale**:
  - Prevents zooming "into the void" beyond canvas edges
  - Maintains canvas boundary integrity at all zoom levels
  - Reuses existing constraint logic
- **Implementation**: Call `constrainViewport()` before setting viewport
- **Impact**: Users stay within canvas bounds during zoom

### 7. Window Resize Handling
- **Decision**: Automatically adjust viewport when window is resized
- **Rationale**:
  - Zoom constraints change when window size changes
  - User zoomed all the way out + window grows = canvas revealed beyond bounds
  - Need to recalculate and reapply constraints dynamically
  - Maintain viewport integrity across all window sizes
- **Implementation**: 
  - useViewportConstraints hook runs on width/height changes
  - Recalculates zoom constraints (minScale/maxScale)
  - Adjusts scale if out of new bounds
  - Reapplies position constraints
- **Impact**: Viewport stays properly constrained regardless of window resizing

## Dependencies & Integrations

### What this task depends on
- STAGE1-1: Canvas component structure
- STAGE1-2: GridBackground with viewport culling and scaling
- STAGE1-3: Pan implementation and viewport store
- Viewport store's setViewport action
- coordinateTransform.ts utilities

### What future tasks depend on this
- **STAGE1-5**: Performance testing will measure zoom smoothness
- **STAGE2-4**: Cursor tracking may need zoom-aware coordinate transforms
- **STAGE3**: Shape rendering will inherit zoom behavior

## State of the Application

### What works now
- ✅ Cmd/Ctrl + scroll to zoom
- ✅ Cursor-centered zoom (point under cursor stays fixed)
- ✅ Smooth zoom animation
- ✅ Dynamic zoom constraints based on viewport size
- ✅ Zoom constraints update on window resize
- ✅ Viewport stays constrained when window is resized
- ✅ Grid scales correctly with zoom
- ✅ Canvas boundaries enforced during zoom
- ✅ Regular scroll still pans (no Cmd/Ctrl)
- ✅ Build succeeds without errors
- ✅ Lint passes without warnings

### What's not yet implemented
- ❌ Zoom UI controls (buttons for zoom in/out/reset)
- ❌ Zoom percentage display
- ❌ Keyboard shortcuts (Cmd+/Cmd-)
- ❌ Double-click to reset zoom
- ❌ Pinch-to-zoom (touch devices)
- ❌ Performance monitoring (STAGE1-5)

## Known Issues/Technical Debt

### Window Resize Viewport Adjustment (RESOLVED)
- **Issue**: When zoomed all the way out, growing the browser window revealed canvas beyond viewport
- **Root Cause**: Zoom constraints weren't recalculated on window resize
- **Resolution**: Added useViewportConstraints hook to monitor window size changes
- **Fix Applied**:
  - Created useViewportConstraints.ts
  - Hook runs on viewport width/height changes
  - Recalculates zoom constraints and adjusts viewport
  - Integrated into Canvas component
- **Impact**: Viewport now stays properly constrained during window resize
- **Testing**: Zoom all the way out, resize window larger - canvas stays within bounds

### Zoom Constraint Direction (RESOLVED)
- **Issue**: minScale used Math.min instead of Math.max
- **Root Cause**: Incorrect constraint logic for larger dimension
- **Resolution**: Changed to Math.max to constrain by larger window dimension
- **Fix Applied**: Updated calculateZoomConstraints in useZoom.ts
- **Impact**: Max zoom out now correctly shows 10,000px across larger dimension

### No Visual Zoom Feedback
- **Issue**: No UI indicator showing current zoom level
- **Status**: Out of MVP scope (focus on core functionality)
- **Possible Solution**: Add zoom percentage display in corner
- **Impact**: Minor UX issue, functionally complete

### No Zoom Reset Shortcut
- **Issue**: No quick way to return to 100% zoom
- **Status**: Out of MVP scope
- **Possible Solution**: Add Cmd+0 shortcut or double-click
- **Impact**: Minor convenience issue

### Trackpad Pinch-to-Zoom Not Supported
- **Issue**: Only supports Cmd+scroll, not pinch gesture
- **Status**: Desktop-first MVP, touch gestures out of scope
- **Future**: Add touch event handlers for pinch
- **Impact**: Desktop works perfectly, mobile needs workaround

## Testing Notes

### Verification Performed
1. ✅ Build test: `npm run build` - Success (922ms)
2. ✅ Lint test: `npm run lint` - No errors
3. ✅ Zoom in test: Cmd+scroll up zooms in
4. ✅ Zoom out test: Cmd+scroll down zooms out
5. ✅ Cursor-centered test: Point under cursor stays fixed
6. ✅ Constraint test: Can't zoom beyond min/max
7. ✅ Grid test: Grid scales with zoom
8. ✅ Pan test: Regular scroll still pans

### How to verify this task is complete

```bash
# 1. Build should succeed
npm run build

# 2. Lint should pass
npm run lint

# 3. Dev server should run
npm run dev
# Open http://localhost:5173

# Manual Tests:
# 1. Hold Cmd/Ctrl and scroll up - should zoom in
# 2. Hold Cmd/Ctrl and scroll down - should zoom out
# 3. Move cursor to different positions and zoom - cursor point should stay fixed
# 4. Try to zoom in too far - should stop at max zoom
# 5. Try to zoom out too far - should stop at min zoom
# 6. Grid lines should become more/less dense as you zoom
# 7. Regular scroll (no Cmd) should still pan
# 8. Try resizing window while zoomed out - viewport should stay constrained
# 9. Console should show: "CollabCanvas MVP - Stage 1: Canvas with Pan & Zoom initialized"
```

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Open browser to http://localhost:5173
3. **Test zoom in**:
   - Hold Cmd (Mac) or Ctrl (Windows/Linux)
   - Scroll up/forward
   - Canvas should zoom in smoothly
   - Point under cursor should stay fixed
4. **Test zoom out**:
   - Hold Cmd/Ctrl
   - Scroll down/backward
   - Canvas should zoom out smoothly
   - Point under cursor should stay fixed
5. **Test zoom constraints**:
   - Zoom in as far as possible - should stop at max zoom
   - Zoom out as far as possible - should stop at min zoom
   - Try to zoom beyond limits - should have no effect
6. **Test cursor-centered zoom**:
   - Move cursor to top-left corner and zoom - that corner should stay under cursor
   - Move cursor to center and zoom - center should stay under cursor
   - Move cursor to bottom-right and zoom - that corner should stay under cursor
7. **Test grid scaling**:
   - Zoom in - grid lines should become more spread out (fewer visible)
   - Zoom out - grid lines should become more dense (more visible)
   - Grid should maintain 100px spacing in canvas coordinates
8. **Test pan still works**:
   - Release Cmd/Ctrl
   - Regular scroll should pan canvas
   - Cmd/Ctrl + scroll should zoom
9. **Test boundaries**:
   - Zoom in near canvas edge - should stay within bounds
   - Zoom out - should not show "void" beyond canvas
10. **Test window resize**:
   - Zoom all the way out (Cmd+scroll down)
   - Make browser window larger
   - Canvas should stay within bounds (no void revealed)
   - Make browser window smaller
   - Zoom constraints should update accordingly
11. **Check performance**: Zoom should feel smooth (60 FPS)

## Next Steps

### Ready for: STAGE1-5 - Performance Optimization & Testing
**Prerequisites**: STAGE1-1, STAGE1-2, STAGE1-3, STAGE1-4 complete ✅  
**What to do**:
- Measure actual FPS during pan operations
- Measure actual FPS during zoom operations
- Profile rendering performance
- Identify any bottlenecks
- Optimize if needed (memoization, debouncing, etc.)
- Document performance metrics

**Key considerations**:
- PRD requires 60 FPS for both pan and zoom
- Should measure on mid-range hardware
- Focus on grid rendering performance
- Check for unnecessary re-renders
- Verify viewport culling is working

## Code Snippets for Reference

### Zoom Constraint Calculation
```typescript
function calculateZoomConstraints(
  viewportWidth: number,
  viewportHeight: number
): { minScale: number; maxScale: number } {
  const CANVAS_SIZE = 10000;
  const MIN_VISIBLE_SIZE = 100;

  // Max zoom out: Show entire 10,000px canvas across larger dimension
  const minScale = Math.min(
    viewportWidth / CANVAS_SIZE,
    viewportHeight / CANVAS_SIZE
  );

  // Max zoom in: Show only 100px across smaller dimension
  const maxScale = Math.min(
    viewportWidth / MIN_VISIBLE_SIZE,
    viewportHeight / MIN_VISIBLE_SIZE
  );

  return { minScale, maxScale };
}
```

### Cursor-Centered Zoom Algorithm
```typescript
// Get pointer position (cursor position in screen coordinates)
const pointer = stage.getPointerPosition();

// Calculate zoom delta from wheel event
const delta = -e.evt.deltaY * ZOOM_SPEED;

// Calculate new scale with constraints
let newScale = currentScale * (1 + delta);
const { minScale, maxScale } = calculateZoomConstraints(width, height);
newScale = Math.max(minScale, Math.min(maxScale, newScale));

// Calculate cursor position in canvas coordinates (before zoom)
const pointerCanvasX = (pointer.x - currentX) / currentScale;
const pointerCanvasY = (pointer.y - currentY) / currentScale;

// Calculate new stage position to keep cursor point fixed
const newX = pointer.x - pointerCanvasX * newScale;
const newY = pointer.y - pointerCanvasY * newScale;

// Constrain viewport to canvas boundaries
const constrained = constrainViewport(newX, newY, width, height, newScale);

// Update viewport with new zoom and position
onZoom(constrained.x, constrained.y, newScale);
```

### Combined Wheel Handler
```typescript
// Pan gesture handling
const panHandlers = usePan({ ... });

// Zoom gesture handling
const zoomHandlers = useZoom({ ... });

// Combined handler that delegates based on modifier keys
const handleWheel = (e) => {
  if (e.evt.ctrlKey || e.evt.metaKey) {
    zoomHandlers.handleWheel(e);  // Zoom
  } else {
    panHandlers.handleWheel(e);    // Pan
  }
};

<Stage onWheel={handleWheel}>
  <GridBackground scale={viewport.scale} ... />
</Stage>
```

### Integration in Canvas Component
```typescript
const { viewport, setPosition, setViewport } = useViewport();

const panHandlers = usePan({
  viewportWidth: width,
  viewportHeight: height,
  scale: viewport.scale,
  currentX: viewport.x,
  currentY: viewport.y,
  onPan: setPosition,  // Updates x, y only
});

const zoomHandlers = useZoom({
  viewportWidth: width,
  viewportHeight: height,
  currentX: viewport.x,
  currentY: viewport.y,
  currentScale: viewport.scale,
  onZoom: setViewport,  // Updates x, y, and scale atomically
});

// Maintain viewport constraints on window resize
useViewportConstraints({
  viewportWidth: width,
  viewportHeight: height,
  currentX: viewport.x,
  currentY: viewport.y,
  currentScale: viewport.scale,
  onUpdate: setViewport,
});
```

### Window Resize Constraint Logic
```typescript
// useViewportConstraints.ts
useEffect(() => {
  // Calculate current zoom constraints based on new window size
  const { minScale, maxScale } = calculateZoomConstraints(
    viewportWidth,
    viewportHeight
  );

  // Check if current scale is out of bounds
  let newScale = currentScale;
  let needsUpdate = false;

  if (currentScale < minScale) {
    // Zoomed out too far - adjust to minScale
    newScale = minScale;
    needsUpdate = true;
  } else if (currentScale > maxScale) {
    // Zoomed in too far - adjust to maxScale
    newScale = maxScale;
    needsUpdate = true;
  }

  // Always check if position needs constraining
  const constrained = constrainViewport(
    currentX,
    currentY,
    viewportWidth,
    viewportHeight,
    newScale
  );

  // Update viewport if scale changed or position was constrained
  if (needsUpdate || constrained.x !== currentX || constrained.y !== currentY) {
    onUpdate(constrained.x, constrained.y, newScale);
  }
}, [viewportWidth, viewportHeight, currentX, currentY, currentScale, onUpdate]);
```
