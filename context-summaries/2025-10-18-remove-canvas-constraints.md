# Context Summary: Remove Canvas Constraints
**Date:** 2025-10-18
**Phase:** STAGE3 (Transform Modal Interactions)
**Status:** Completed

## What Was Built
Removed all canvas boundary constraints from drag, rotate, and scale operations. Objects can now be positioned and transformed beyond the 10,000 x 10,000px canvas boundaries, providing an "infinite canvas" experience.

## Key Files Modified
- `src/features/displayObjects/common/hooks/useCollectionDrag.ts` - Removed `constrainToCanvas` call
- `src/features/displayObjects/common/hooks/useRotation.ts` - Removed `constrainToCanvas` calls (3 places)
- `src/features/displayObjects/common/hooks/useScale.ts` - Removed `constrainToCanvas` calls (3 places)
- `src/features/displayObjects/shapes/components/RectangleShape.tsx` - Removed `dragBoundFunc`

## Technical Decisions Made

### Constraint Removal:
**Before:**
- ✅ Individual shape drag - constrained via `dragBoundFunc`
- ✅ Collection drag - constrained via `translateAndConstrain`
- ✅ Rotation - constrained via `constrainToCanvas`
- ✅ Scale - constrained via `constrainToCanvas`

**After:**
- ❌ Individual shape drag - **NO constraints**
- ❌ Collection drag - **NO constraints**
- ❌ Rotation - **NO constraints**
- ❌ Scale - **NO constraints**

### Changes Made:

1. **RectangleShape.tsx:**
   - Removed `dragBoundFunc` function
   - Removed `dragBoundFunc` prop from `Rect` component
   - Shapes can now be dragged anywhere

2. **useCollectionDrag.ts:**
   - Changed from `translateAndConstrain` to just using `translatedShapes` directly
   - Removed import of `translateAndConstrain`
   - Collections can now be dragged anywhere

3. **useRotation.ts:**
   - Removed `constrainToCanvas` import
   - Removed 3 calls to `constrainToCanvas`:
     - Optimistic update
     - Debounced write
     - Final write
   - Objects can rotate to any position

4. **useScale.ts:**
   - Removed `constrainToCanvas` import
   - Removed 3 calls to `constrainToCanvas`:
     - Optimistic update
     - Debounced write
     - Final write
   - Objects can scale to any position

## Dependencies & Integrations
- **No longer uses:** `constrainToCanvas` from `transformService.ts`
- **Pattern:** Matches "infinite canvas" design pattern
- **Affects:** All drag, rotation, and scale interactions

## State of the Application
- ✅ Objects can be dragged outside the 10,000 x 10,000 canvas area
- ✅ Objects can be rotated to positions outside canvas boundaries
- ✅ Objects can be scaled to positions outside canvas boundaries
- ✅ No visual or functional restrictions on object positioning
- ✅ Pan/zoom still works correctly (viewport constraints remain)
- ✅ All transform operations remain smooth (optimistic updates intact)

## Known Issues/Technical Debt
- **Consideration:** Objects can be lost if moved very far from origin
- **Consideration:** May want to add "bring to viewport" or "reset position" feature
- **Note:** Viewport pan/zoom constraints remain in place (user cannot pan beyond canvas edges unless objects exist there)

## Testing Notes
**Test infinite canvas:**
1. **Drag beyond boundaries:**
   - Create shape near canvas edge (x=9500, y=9500)
   - Drag it past 10,000 on both axes
   - **Expected:** Shape continues moving without constraint

2. **Rotate outside canvas:**
   - Create objects near edge
   - Rotate so they extend beyond 10,000
   - **Expected:** Objects rotate freely

3. **Scale outside canvas:**
   - Create object near edge
   - Scale up to very large size (100x)
   - **Expected:** Object scales freely, parts can extend beyond canvas

4. **Extreme positioning:**
   - Drag object to x=50000, y=50000
   - Pan viewport to find it
   - **Expected:** Object still exists and can be selected/moved

## Next Steps
- Consider adding visual indicators for objects far from canvas origin
- Consider adding "recenter" or "fit to viewport" functionality
- STAGE3-11: Properties Panel for numeric property editing

## Code Snippets for Reference

### RectangleShape.tsx (Before vs After)
```typescript
// BEFORE: Had dragBoundFunc
const dragBoundFunc = (pos: { x: number; y: number }) => {
  const CANVAS_SIZE = 10000;
  const halfWidth = (shape.width * shape.scaleX) / 2;
  const halfHeight = (shape.height * shape.scaleY) / 2;
  
  return {
    x: Math.max(halfWidth, Math.min(pos.x, CANVAS_SIZE - halfWidth)),
    y: Math.max(halfHeight, Math.min(pos.y, CANVAS_SIZE - halfHeight)),
  };
};

// Rect component
<Rect
  dragBoundFunc={isDraggable ? dragBoundFunc : undefined}
  ...
/>

// AFTER: No dragBoundFunc
<Rect
  draggable={isDraggable}
  ...
/>
```

### useCollectionDrag.ts (Before vs After)
```typescript
// BEFORE:
import { translateAndConstrain } from '../services/transformService';

const constrainedShapes = translateAndConstrain(translatedShapes, 0, 0);
setOptimisticShapes(constrainedShapes);

// AFTER:
// No import needed
setOptimisticShapes(translatedShapes);
```

### useRotation.ts (Before vs After)
```typescript
// BEFORE:
import { constrainToCanvas } from '../services/transformService';

const rotatedObjects = rotateCollection(...);
const constrainedObjects = constrainToCanvas(rotatedObjects);
constrainedObjects.forEach(obj => { ... });

// AFTER:
// No import
const rotatedObjects = rotateCollection(...);
rotatedObjects.forEach(obj => { ... });
```

## Questions for Next Session
- Should we add a "home" button to return to canvas origin (0, 0)?
- Should we add warnings when objects are very far from canvas center?
- Should we add minimap or navigator to help find lost objects?
