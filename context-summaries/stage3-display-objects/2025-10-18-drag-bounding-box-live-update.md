# Context Summary: Collection Drag Bounding Box Live Update
**Date:** 2025-10-18
**Phase:** STAGE 3 - Collection Drag Enhancement
**Status:** Completed

## What Was Built
Fixed the selection indicators (both individual object OBBs with solid blue lines and collection OBB with dashed blue line) to update in real-time during collection drag operations instead of only updating after release.

## Key Files Modified/Created
- `src/features/canvas/hooks/useCanvasInteractions.ts` - Moved `useCollectionDrag` call here, uses optimistic shapes for bounding boxes
- `src/features/canvas/components/Canvas.tsx` - Passes drag handlers to `CanvasLayers`
- `src/features/canvas/components/CanvasLayers.tsx` - Passes drag handlers to `ShapeLayer`
- `src/features/displayObjects/shapes/components/ShapeLayer.tsx` - Receives drag handlers as props instead of calling hook

## Technical Decisions Made
- **Problem:** Bounding boxes were calculated from original `selectedShapes` from Firestore, not from the optimistic shapes created during drag. This caused indicators to lag behind the dragged shapes.
- **Root Cause:** `useCollectionDrag` was called in `ShapeLayer` (component), but `useBoundingBox` was called in `useCanvasInteractions` (hook). The optimistic shapes couldn't flow from one to the other.
- **Solution:** Moved `useCollectionDrag` call from `ShapeLayer` to `useCanvasInteractions` so both drag logic and bounding box logic can access the same optimistic shapes.
- **Architecture Pattern:** Data flows down from hook → component hierarchy via props.

## Architecture Changes

### Before (Separated):
```
ShapeLayer (component)
  └─ useCollectionDrag() → optimisticShapes (isolated)
  └─ Renders shapes with optimistic positions

useCanvasInteractions (hook)
  └─ useBoundingBox(selectedShapes) ← Uses original shapes
  └─ Bounding boxes lag behind!
```

### After (Unified):
```
useCanvasInteractions (hook)
  └─ useCollectionDrag() → dragOptimisticShapes
  └─ useBoundingBox(dragOptimisticShapes || selectedShapes)
  └─ Returns drag handlers + data
  ↓
Canvas (component)
  └─ Receives handlers + data
  ↓
CanvasLayers (component)
  └─ Passes to ShapeLayer
  ↓
ShapeLayer (component)
  └─ Uses drag handlers (no longer calls hook)
```

## Code Changes Summary

### 1. useCanvasInteractions.ts
**Added:**
- Import `useCollectionDrag` and `useAuth`
- Call `useCollectionDrag` with selected shapes
- Use `dragOptimisticShapes || selectedShapes` for bounding box calculations
- Return drag handlers in interface

### 2. ShapeLayer.tsx
**Changed:**
- Removed `useCollectionDrag` and `useTool` imports
- Added drag handler props to interface
- Receives handlers as props instead of calling hook
- Renamed `optimisticShapes` to `dragOptimisticShapes` for consistency

### 3. Canvas.tsx + CanvasLayers.tsx
**Changed:**
- Added drag handler props to interfaces
- Pass drag handlers down through component hierarchy

## Dependencies & Integrations
- **Depends on:** `useCollectionDrag` hook
- **Affects:** Visual rendering of bounding boxes during drag
- **Pattern used:** Same as rotation box fix - use transformed data during active operations

## State of the Application
- ✅ Individual object OBBs update in real-time during drag
- ✅ Collection OBB updates in real-time during drag
- ✅ Shapes render at dragged positions
- ✅ Bounding boxes match shape positions perfectly
- ✅ No lag or snap-back behavior

## Known Issues/Technical Debt
- None

## Testing Notes
**Test drag behavior:**
1. Select multiple objects
2. Drag any selected object
3. **Expected:** Blue solid OBBs and dashed collection box move smoothly with shapes
4. **Previous:** Bounding boxes stayed at original position until release
5. On release: Positions sync to Firestore, everything updates

## Next Steps
- Continue with STAGE3-10: Scale Knob Implementation

## Important Context for Next Session
**Architectural Pattern for Optimistic Updates with Bounding Boxes:**

When implementing transforms that need live bounding box updates:

1. **Call transform hook at highest level** where both transform logic and bounding box logic have access
2. **Use optimistic data for calculations:** `useBoundingBox(optimisticShapes || normalShapes)`
3. **Pass handlers down via props** to rendering components
4. **Pattern:**
   ```typescript
   // In coordinating hook/component
   const { optimisticData, handlers } = useTransform(...);
   const boundingBox = useBoundingBox(optimisticData || normalData);
   
   // Pass both down to children
   return { ...handlers, boundingBox };
   ```

This ensures bounding boxes always reflect the current visual state, whether it's from:
- Normal Firestore data (at rest)
- Optimistic local updates (during transforms)
- Rotated corners (during rotation)
- Dragged positions (during drag)
