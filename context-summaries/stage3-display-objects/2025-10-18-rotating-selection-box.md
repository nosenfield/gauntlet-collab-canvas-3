# Context Summary: Rotating Selection Box Fix
**Date:** 2025-10-18
**Phase:** STAGE 3 - STAGE3-9: Rotation Knob Implementation
**Status:** Completed

## What Was Built
Fixed the collection selection indicator (blue dashed box) to rotate as a rigid body during rotation, rather than recalculating and expanding to contain all rotated objects in an axis-aligned manner.

## Key Files Modified/Created
- `src/features/displayObjects/common/hooks/useRotation.ts` - Store and rotate initial OBB corners
- `src/features/displayObjects/common/components/TransformModal.tsx` - Expose rotated corners via callback
- `src/features/canvas/components/Canvas.tsx` - Receive and pass rotated corners to rendering layer
- `src/features/displayObjects/common/utils/transformMath.ts` - Exported `rotatePointAroundCenter` helper

## Technical Decisions Made
- **Problem:** During rotation, `useBoundingBox` was recalculating the collection OBB every frame based on current object positions. This created an axis-aligned box that expanded/contracted as objects rotated.
- **User Expectation:** The selection box should rotate as a rigid body, maintaining its original dimensions.
- **Solution:** 
  1. Store the initial collection OBB corners when rotation starts
  2. Rotate those corners around the collection center during rotation
  3. Pass the rotated corners to the rendering layer
  4. Use rotated corners instead of recalculating OBB

## Architecture Flow

```
useRotation (in TransformModal)
  ↓ startRotation → Calculate initial collection OBB
  ↓ updateRotation → Rotate initial corners around center
  ↓ rotatedCollectionCorners (state)
  ↓ useEffect → onRotationCornersChange callback
  ↓
Canvas component
  ↓ rotationCorners (state)
  ↓ Pass to CanvasLayers as collectionCorners
  ↓
BoundingBoxLayer
  ↓ Render rotated box using collectionCorners
```

## Code Changes

### 1. useRotation.ts
**Store initial corners:**
```typescript
const initialCollectionCornersRef = useRef<Point[] | null>(null);
const [rotatedCollectionCorners, setRotatedCollectionCorners] = useState<Point[] | null>(null);

// On start
const collectionOBB = calculateCollectionOBB(selectedShapes);
initialCollectionCornersRef.current = collectionOBB?.corners || null;
setRotatedCollectionCorners(collectionOBB?.corners || null);
```

**Rotate corners on update:**
```typescript
// In updateRotation
if (initialCollectionCornersRef.current && initialCenterRef.current) {
  const rotatedCorners = initialCollectionCornersRef.current.map(corner =>
    rotatePointAroundCenter(corner, cumulativeAngleRef.current, initialCenterRef.current!)
  );
  setRotatedCollectionCorners(rotatedCorners);
}
```

### 2. TransformModal.tsx
**Expose rotated corners via callback:**
```typescript
export interface TransformModalProps {
  // ... existing props
  onRotationCornersChange?: (corners: Point[] | null) => void;
}

// In component
useEffect(() => {
  if (onRotationCornersChange) {
    onRotationCornersChange(rotatedCollectionCorners);
  }
}, [rotatedCollectionCorners, onRotationCornersChange]);
```

### 3. Canvas.tsx
**Receive and use rotated corners:**
```typescript
const [rotationCorners, setRotationCorners] = useState<Point[] | null>(null);

const handleRotationCornersChange = useCallback((corners: Point[] | null) => {
  setRotationCorners(corners);
}, []);

// Pass to rendering
<CanvasLayers
  collectionCorners={rotationCorners || collectionCorners}  // ← Use rotated if available
  // ... other props
/>

<TransformModal
  onRotationCornersChange={handleRotationCornersChange}
  // ... other props
/>
```

## Dependencies & Integrations
- **Depends on:** `calculateCollectionOBB`, `rotatePointAroundCenter`
- **Affects:** Visual rendering of collection selection box during rotation

## State of the Application
- ✅ Collection selection box rotates as rigid body
- ✅ Box maintains original dimensions during rotation
- ✅ Smooth visual feedback during rotation
- ✅ Box returns to normal (recalculated) after rotation ends

## Known Issues/Technical Debt
- None

## Testing Notes
**Test rotation behavior:**
1. Select multiple objects
2. Drag rotation knob
3. **Expected:** Blue dashed box rotates smoothly, maintaining its rectangular shape
4. **Previous:** Box would expand/contract to form axis-aligned rectangle around rotated objects
5. On release: Box reverts to recalculated OBB (normal behavior)

## Next Steps
- Continue with STAGE3-10: Scale Knob Implementation

## Important Context for Next Session
**Pattern for Transform Override During Active Transforms:**

When implementing transforms (rotation, scale, etc.), if you want the UI to behave differently during the active transform:

1. Calculate and store initial state in the transform hook (e.g., `useRotation`)
2. Apply transform to that initial state during the interaction
3. Expose the transformed result via return value
4. Pass it through component hierarchy via callbacks/props
5. Use it in rendering layer with fallback: `transformedValue || normalValue`
6. Reset to null when transform ends

This pattern allows:
- ✅ Smooth, predictable UI during transforms
- ✅ Proper cleanup after transforms
- ✅ Separation of concerns (transform logic vs rendering logic)
- ✅ Easy to extend to other transforms (scale, skew, etc.)
