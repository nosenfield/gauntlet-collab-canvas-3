## 🔑 Key Technical Decisions Made

### 1. Per-Tab Presence Architecture ⭐⭐⭐
**Context:** Initial implementation had 30-second delay when closing all tabs  
**Decision:** Refactor from localStorage coordination to per-tab RTDB entries  
**Rationale:**
- Simplicity: No coordination logic needed
- Reliability: Server-side onDisconnect() guarantees cleanup
- Natural multi-tab: Tabs are independent entities
- Performance: Single heartbeat instead of dual

**Impact:** 40% code reduction, immediate cleanup (1-2s), more maintainable

**Reference:** `context-summaries/2025-10-17-stage2-5-session-persistence-testing.md`

### 2. Dual-Database Architecture
**Decision:** Firebase Realtime Database for ephemeral data, Firestore for persistent data  
**Rationale:**
- Realtime DB: <50ms cursor updates (high-frequency, low-latency)
- Firestore: 100-300ms shape updates (complex queries, transactions)
- Right tool for each job

**Data Distribution:**
- Realtime DB: `/presence/main/{userId}/{tabId}` (cursor positions, heartbeats)
- Firestore: `/users/{userId}` (profiles), `/documents/main/shapes/{shapeId}` (shapes)

**Reference:** `context-summaries/2025-10-17-setup-2-firebase-configuration.md`

### 3. Feature-Based Architecture
**Decision:** Organize by feature modules instead of technical layers  
**Rationale:**
- Co-location: Related code stays together
- Scalability: Easy to add/remove features
- Clarity: Clear boundaries between features

**Structure:**
```
features/
├── auth/         (services, hooks, store, components)
├── canvas/       (services, hooks, store, components, utils)
├── presence/     (services, hooks, store, components)
└── shapes/       (ready for Stage 3)
```

**Reference:** `context-summaries/2025-10-17-setup-1-project-structure.md`

### 4. Viewport Store with Context API
**Decision:** useReducer + Context for viewport state instead of external library  
**Rationale:**
- MVP simplicity: Don't need Redux/Zustand yet
- Performance: Context + memo prevents unnecessary rerenders
- Flexibility: Easy to migrate later if needed

**Reference:** `context-summaries/2025-10-17-stage1-3-pan-implementation.md`

### 5. Cursor-Centered Zoom with Math Transform
**Decision:** Calculate new pan position to keep cursor point fixed during zoom  
**Rationale:**
- UX: Matches Figma/professional tools behavior
- Intuitive: Users expect to zoom toward cursor
- Math: `newPos = pointer - (mousePointTo * newScale)`

**Reference:** `context-summaries/2025-10-17-stage1-4-zoom-implementation.md`

## 🐛 Issues Resolved

### 1. Presence Persisted After Sign-Out
**Discovered:** Stage 2-5 testing  
**Symptom:** Users remained online for 30s after clicking "Sign Out"  
**Root Cause:** onDisconnect() only fires on WebSocket disconnect, not unmount  
**Solution:** Added manual `removeTabPresence()` call in cleanup function  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

**Reference:** `context-summaries/2025-10-17-stage2-5-session-persistence-testing.md` (lines 428-484)

### 2. Complex localStorage Coordination
**Discovered:** Stage 2-2 user feedback  
**Symptom:** Complex primary tab election with race conditions  
**Root Cause:** Over-engineered solution, trying to coordinate tabs client-side  
**Solution:** Refactored to per-tab RTDB entries, let Firebase handle it  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed (architectural improvement)

**Reference:** `context-summaries/2025-10-17-stage2-5-session-persistence-testing.md` (lines 21-51)

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### 1. Simplicity Wins
**Observation:** Started with complex localStorage coordination, ended with simple per-tab entries  
**Lesson:** Question assumptions early, seek simplest solution  
**Application:** Always ask "Can this be simpler?" before implementing

### 2. Let the Platform Do the Work
**Observation:** Firebase onDisconnect() is server-side and reliable  
**Lesson:** Use platform features instead of reinventing  
**Application:** Study platform capabilities before building custom solutions

### 3. Aggregate on Read, Not Write
**Observation:** Multiple tab entries, single aggregated read  
**Lesson:** Separation of concerns - simple writes, complex reads  
**Application:** Push complexity to read side when possible

### 4. User Feedback is Gold
**Observation:** "This solution seems overly complex" led to better architecture  
**Lesson:** Listen to complexity concerns, they're usually right  
**Application:** Welcome feedback on architecture, it reveals blind spots

### 5. Performance Requires Measurement
**Observation:** Chrome DevTools Performance tab revealed grid optimization opportunities  
**Lesson:** Can't optimize what you don't measure  
**Application:** Always profile before optimizing, verify after

## 🚀 Next Steps: Stage 3 Preview

### STAGE3-1: Shape Data Model & Firestore Setup (Next Task)

**Objective:** Define shape data structures and set up Firestore collections

**Will Implement:**
- Shape interface in TypeScript (BaseShape, Rectangle, Circle, Line)
- Firestore collection: `/documents/main/shapes/{shapeId}`
- Shape service layer for CRUD operations
- Real-time shape listener foundation

**Depends On:**
- ✅ User authentication (for `createdBy`, `lockedBy`)
- ✅ User presence (for lock validation)
- ✅ Canvas viewport (for coordinate system)

**Estimated Complexity:** Medium  
**Critical Decision Points:**
- Shape transformation storage (position vs. transform matrix)
- Lock mechanism design (optimistic vs. pessimistic)
- Z-index management strategy

### Stage 3 Overview (14 Tasks)

**Goals:**
1. Create and render basic shapes (rectangles, circles, lines)
2. Implement selection system with visual feedback
3. Build transformation system (drag, resize, rotate)
4. Add collaborative locking to prevent conflicts
5. Create properties panel for shape editing
6. Implement Z-index management
7. Achieve <300ms shape synchronization latency

**Foundation Ready:**
- ✅ User identification system
- ✅ Real-time presence tracking
- ✅ Coordinate transformation utilities
- ✅ Canvas rendering pipeline
- ✅ Performance monitoring tools

## 💡 Recommendations for Next Session

### Before Starting Stage 3:
1. ✅ Review `_docs/PRD.md` Stage 3 requirements
2. ✅ Read Stage 3 tasks in `_docs/TASK_LIST.md`
3. ✅ Review `_docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` shape synchronization section
4. ⚠️ Consider creating `STAGE3-PLANNING.md` for complex tasks

### During Stage 3:
- **Start small:** Begin with rectangles only, add other shapes after
- **Test incrementally:** Verify each feature before proceeding
- **Multi-user testing:** Test shape locking with 2+ browser windows
- **Performance monitoring:** Use `performanceMonitor.ts` throughout
- **Context summaries:** Continue creating after each task

### Technical Considerations:
- **Locking strategy:** Decide between optimistic and pessimistic locking
- **Transform operations:** Consider using Konva's built-in transformers
- **Z-index:** Plan for efficient reordering with many shapes
- **Sync latency:** Implement debouncing for transform operations
- **Conflict resolution:** Handle simultaneous edits gracefully
