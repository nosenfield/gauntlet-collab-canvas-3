## Critical Path (MVP Checkpoint)

**Must be completed for MVP:**
- âœ… Project setup and Firebase configuration
- Canvas rendering with pan/zoom
- Canvas boundary enforcement
- Anonymous user creation
- User presence system
- Multiplayer cursor sync
- At least one shape type (rectangle)
- Basic shape creation (draw)
- Basic shape movement (drag)
- Real-time sync between 2+ users
- Deployed and publicly accessible

**Verification:** Demo to another person in 2 browser windows showing simultaneous editing.

---

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Items
1. **Real-time sync performance** - Start early, test frequently
2. **Object locking race conditions** - Implement early, test edge cases
3. **Canvas boundary math** - Test thoroughly with edge cases
4. **Firestore quota limits** - Monitor usage, optimize queries

### Backup Plans
- If Konva.js issues â†’ Consider HTML5 Canvas fallback
- If Firestore issues â†’ Consider Supabase as alternative
- If deployment issues â†’ Use Vercel as backup hosting

## Notes for Cursor AI Agent

- Follow React architecture guide for all component development
- Use functional components with hooks exclusively
- Implement TypeScript types for all data structures
- Follow feature-based folder structure
- Prioritize real-time sync reliability over features
- Test each phase incrementally before moving to next
- Focus on MVP checklist - no additional features
